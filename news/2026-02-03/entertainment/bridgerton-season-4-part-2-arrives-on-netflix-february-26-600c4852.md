## Summary
Bridgerton Season 4 Part 2 premieres on Netflix on February 26, 2026, focusing on Benedict Bridgerton's proposal and romantic tension, following the split-season release that began January 29.

## Full Article
Netflix opens February with a deep and diverse slate that balances buzzy originals, comfort rewatches, and heavyweight movies. The calendar leans into romance and reality early, then pivots toward thrillers and prestige drama as the month builds. Whether you want cozy nostalgia or late night edge, this lineup keeps momentum from start to finish.

The month’s biggest swing

The headline title lands late. Bridgerton Season four part two arrives on February twenty six and pushes Benedict Bridgerton to a crossroads, Variety reports. His proposal sparks debate inside the ton and leaves Sophie holding the final word. The split season strategy pays off here, letting tension breathe while rewarding patient fans with a focused stretch of romance, secrets, and social maneuvering.

Reality hits and returning favorites

February stays busy with new chapters of long running hits. Love Is Blind reaches season ten on February eleven and keeps its signature mix of earnest connections and jaw dropping turns. The Night Agent returns for season three on February nineteen, continuing its brisk pace and high stakes political intrigue. Legal drama fans also get The Lincoln Lawyer season four on February five, which sharpens the courtroom chess while expanding Mickey Haller’s personal fallout.
