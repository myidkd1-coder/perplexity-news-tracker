Global Trade Outlook Dims for 2026

Global trade faces a challenging year ahead as growth is forecast to decelerate sharply. UNCTAD anticipates global growth dipping to 2.6%, with the World Trade Organization projecting trade volume growth to ease to approximately 0.5% in 2026, down from 2.4% in 2025. This slowdown reflects a complex global economic environment shaped by shifting policies and geopolitical tensions.

Tariff Volatility Dominates Concerns

U.S. trade tariffs are a primary source of uncertainty for businesses worldwide. An estimated 72% of global trade professionals identify U.S. tariff volatility as the most impactful regulatory change, affecting manufacturing margins and product quality. Many expect this shift in U.S. trade policy to persist for at least four years, signaling a potential long-term recalibration of global trade flows.

AI: A Potential Growth Engine

Despite broader slowdowns, emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence, present a bright spot. AI-related goods, including semiconductors and telecommunications equipment, are experiencing accelerated demand. AI spending significantly boosted global trade in the first half of 2025, turning Asian emerging markets into key manufacturing and export hubs. The global semiconductor market, projected to reach $1 trillion in 2026, offers optimism, though policy risks remain.

India's Export Resilience Tested

India's export sector has demonstrated notable resilience through 2025, with total exports exceeding $560 billion between April and November, a 5.5% increase amidst global uncertainties. This performance is supported by market diversification and steady gains in merchandise exports, particularly in engineering goods, electronics, and pharmaceuticals.

Strategy for 2026: Resilience Over Growth

For India, the focus in 2026 will shift towards resilience rather than solely growth. The upcoming budget is seen as a crucial platform to bolster this strategy. Building on last year's export promotion mission, which allocated over ₹25,000 crore, the government is expected to introduce reforms targeting trade finance, competitiveness, and process simplification. Reforms aimed at mitigating tariff impacts on vulnerable sectors like textiles, gems, and marine products are anticipated. Expediting Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations with the U.S., EU, and Mexico is also a priority to diversify exports and attract investment.
