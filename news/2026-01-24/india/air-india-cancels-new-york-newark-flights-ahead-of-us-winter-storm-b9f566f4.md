According to CNN, two-thirds of the US population is facing a monster winter storm and extreme cold. The storm's snow and ice will stretch over 2,000 miles from Texas to New England as it moves east through the weekend.

This would result in crippling ice accumulations affecting power lines, with hundreds of thousands may lose power, some for days.

Thousands of flights have already been cancelled ahead of the storm, with travel on roads across the storm's footprint said to be difficult to impossible.

It reported that at least 15 states have declared a state of emergency to mobilise resources for responding and preparing for the storm as of Friday afternoon.

These include Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, New York, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey and Kansas.Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a disaster declaration covering 134 counties to mobilise resources. Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser also declared a state of emergency for the nation's capital on Friday.

As per CNN, more than half of all Americans will experience subzero wind chills in the next week.

Ahead of the historic winter storm that would affect most of the United States over the weekend, US President Donald Trump on Saturday said that the administration is coordinating with state and local officials, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) ready to respond.
