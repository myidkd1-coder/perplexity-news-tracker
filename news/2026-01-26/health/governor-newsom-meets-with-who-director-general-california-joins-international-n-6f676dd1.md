## Summary
As the U.S. withdraws from WHO under Trump, California becomes the first state to join a WHO-coordinated global outbreak response network for rapid detection of public health threats. This builds on initiatives like PHNIX and the West Coast Health Alliance for science-based health leadership.

## Full Article
GOARN is a WHO-coordinated international network that brings together hundreds of public health institutions, national governments, academic centers, laboratories, and response organizations worldwide. GOARN’s mission is to rapidly detect, verify, assess, and respond to emerging public health threats – particularly those with cross-border or pandemic potential.

California’s health care leadership

As the Trump administration retreats from responsible health care leadership, California has routinely stepped up to fill the gaps.

Last month, Governor Newsom announced the launch of the Public Health Network Innovation Exchange (PHNIX), a new California-led initiative to modernize public health infrastructure and maintain trust in science-driven decision-making. To lead this work, the state engaged some of the nation’s most respected public health voices, including Dr. Susan Monarez, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Dr. Debra Houry, former CDC Chief Medical Officer; and Dr. Katelyn Jetelina, founder and CEO of Your Local Epidemiologist, to work with and advise California’s public health leaders.

In October, Governor Gavin Newsom joined 14 other Governors in launching the Governors Public Health Alliance, a new non-partisan hub coordinating public health leadership across the country. The Alliance helps to strengthen emergency preparedness, improve communication, facilitate sharing data and expertise, and ensure states and territories can respond quickly and consistently to emerging health threats.

Last year, California also joined the states of Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington in launching the West Coast Health Alliance. Through this partnership, the four states have coordinated health guidelines by aligning immunization recommendations informed by respected national medical organizations, allowing residents to receive consistent, science-based recommendations they can rely on — regardless of shifting federal actions.

In September, Governor Newsom signed AB 144, authorizing California to base immunization guidance on credible, independent medical organizations rather than the CDC’s increasingly politicized Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). That same day, the West Coast Health Alliance announced coordinated winter virus vaccination recommendations, including the 2025–26 COVID-19, influenza, and RSV vaccines.
