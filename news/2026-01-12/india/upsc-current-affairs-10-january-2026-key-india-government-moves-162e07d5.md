Subject: Dairy sector

Context: The National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) has reached a milestone in digitalizing the dairy sector, notably generating over 35.68 crore “Pashu Aadhaar” IDs.

About Digitalizing India’s Dairy Sector :

What it is?

India is the global leader in milk production, contributing 25% of the world’s output. Digitalization is the Second White Revolution, shifting the focus from mere production to traceability, efficiency, and value addition.

Trends and Data Facts:

Production: India produced 221.06 million tonnes of milk (2021-22), a 73% increase over the last decade.

India produced of milk (2021-22), a 73% increase over the last decade. Market Value : The sector was valued at Billion in 2021 and is projected to reach Billion by 2027.

The sector was valued at and is projected to reach Billion by 2027. Digital Reach : Over 17.3 lakh producers are now integrated into the Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS).

Over are now integrated into the Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS). Consumption: Per capita availability has risen to 444 grams per day, significantly higher than the global average.

Importance of the Dairy Sector in India:

Rural Livelihood Security: It provides a regular source of income for over 80 million rural households.

E.g. In regions like Vidarbha and Marathwada, dairy acts as a safety net against crop failures, reducing the incidence of farmer distress.

Nutritional Security: Milk is a primary source of animal protein for India’s largely vegetarian population.

E.g. Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal increasingly include fortified milk to combat Vitamin A and D deficiencies in children.

Economic Contribution: The dairy sector contributes significantly to the agricultural GDP, often surpassing the combined value of rice and wheat.

E.g. In Gujarat, the Amul model contributes billions to the state economy, demonstrating dairy as a commercial powerhouse.

Women Empowerment: Dairying is primarily managed by women, providing them with financial independence.

E.g. Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have successfully taken over milk collection centers, enhancing their social standing.

Inclusive Growth: Livestock distribution is more equitable than land distribution, benefiting small and marginal farmers.

E.g. Roughly 75% of rural households own just 2–4 animals, yet they drive the bulk of India’s 25% global market share.

Initiatives Taken for Digitalization:

National Digital Livestock Mission (NDLM): Creating Bharat Pashudhan, a database for breeding, health, and vaccination records.

Creating Bharat Pashudhan, a database for breeding, health, and vaccination records. Pashu Aadhaar: Issuing 12-digit unique ID ear tags to animals for full traceability.

Issuing 12-digit unique ID ear tags to animals for full traceability. Automatic Milk Collection System (AMCS): Digitizing milk fat testing and payments to ensure farmers get fair prices instantly.

Digitizing milk fat testing and payments to ensure farmers get fair prices instantly. NDDB Dairy ERP (NDERP): An open-source software (ERPNext) to manage supply chains from cow to consumer.

An open-source software (ERPNext) to manage supply chains from cow to consumer. GIS Route Optimisation: Using satellite mapping to reduce milk procurement distances and fuel costs for cooperatives.

Overall Challenges in the Dairy Sector:

Low Productivity per Animal: Average milk yield in India is 987 kg per lactation, far below the global average of 2,038 kg.

E.g. Indigenous breeds often produce less than cross-bred varieties due to a lack of focused genetic upgrades in many states.

Fragmented Supply Chain: About 75–85% of the marketable surplus still flows through the unorganized/informal sector.

E.g. Local milkmen (Dudhiyas) in North India often lack cold chain infrastructure, leading to higher spoilage and quality issues.

Feed and Fodder Scarcity : Rising costs of concentrates and shrinking grazing lands affect profitability.

E.g. High inflation in maize and soybean prices recently forced many dairy unions to hike milk prices to cover input costs.

Quality and Adulteration: Maintaining global sanitary standards is a hurdle for exports.

E.g. India’s share in global dairy exports is <1% because many products fail to meet the strict phytosanitary norms of the EU and USA.

Lack of Formal Credit: Smallholders struggle to get loans for expanding herds or upgrading technology.

E.g. Farmers often rely on local moneylenders at high interest rates because commercial banks perceive livestock as a high-risk asset.

Way Ahead:

Scaling Breed Improvement: Focus on Artificial Insemination (AI) and genomic selection to boost the productivity of indigenous cattle.

E.g. The Semen Station Management System (SSMS) ensures that only high-quality, traceable semen doses are used nationwide.

Strengthening the Cold Chain: Expanding bulk milk chillers at the village level to reduce spoilage and improve Clean Milk Production.

E.g. NDDB’s AMCS integration allows cooperatives to monitor milk temperature and quality in real-time from remote villages.

Promoting Value-Added Products: Shifting from liquid milk to high-margin products like cheese, probiotics, and organic milk.

E.g. Brands like Epigamia and Amul are rapidly expanding into high-protein yogurts to meet urban health-conscious demand.

Enhancing Export Competitiveness : Aligning Indian standards with Codex Alimentarius to tap into South Asian and Middle Eastern markets.

E.g. Creating Export Zones for dairy in states like Gujarat can help standardize quality for international certification.

Formalizing Credit through Technology: Using Pashu Aadhaar data as collateral for digital lending by banks.

E.g. Fintech startups are now exploring Livestock Credit Scores based on the health and milk records stored in the NDLM database.

Conclusion:

By merging the traditional cooperative strength with cutting-edge digital tools like NDLM and AMCS, India is evolving into a transparent and efficient dairy superpower. This digital shift ensures that the benefits of the White Revolution reach the smallest farmer, securing India’s position as a global leader in sustainable and technology-driven milk production.

Secure answer writing practice question Q. White Revolution 2.0 in India aims to revitalize the dairy sector and extend the success of the original White Revolution to other agricultural domains. Discuss steps to bring about White Revolution 2.0.

Subject: Economy

Context: TERI released “India’s PV Manufacturing & Its Strategic Inflection Points” at Bharat Climate Forum 2026, alongside the launch of the National Cleantech Manufacturing Implementation Plan, spotlighting how India can capture more value from its solar boom.

About TERI report on India’s PV manufacturing landscape :

What it is?

A strategic, policy-and-industry assessment of India’s solar PV manufacturing value chain (from polysilicon → ingots/wafers → cells → modules), identifying inflection points where targeted policy, finance, R&D and skilling can make India globally competitive and resilient.

Key trends highlighted:

Global PV scale + China concentration: Global cumulative PV hit ~2.2 TW (end-2024); module manufacturing capacity projected ~1.8 TW by end-2025, with ~80% concentrated in China across the full chain. China’s dominance is near- monopoly upstream : China’s market shares are extremely high (e.g., ~98% wafers, ~92% polysilicon, ~91.8% cells, ~84.6% modules). India’s current position is downstream-heavy: India’s FY2025 manufacturing is “anchored” in modules; module assembly capacity ~120 GW/year. Policy has driven module scale-up: Expansion is linked to PLI, high import tariffs on finished panels, and ALMM creating domestic demand-pull. Ambition to scale fast by 2030: India’s module capacity is projected to exceed ~280 GW/year by 2030, with cell capacity rising from ~30 GW to ~171 GW/year. Finance is the make-or-break enabler for upstream: The report proposes sovereign “Green PV Bonds” to lower borrowing costs. Need for ecosystem: It recommends Solar Manufacturing Technology Parks and a PV–Semiconductor Skill Council; also highlights structured recycling/circularity roles for governments, OEMs, developers, MSMEs and investors.

Opportunities:

Upstream value capture (polysilicon→wafer→cell integration) India already has ~120 GW/yr module capacity and plans steep scale-up by 2030; building upstream alongside this demand can retain value domestically. Low-cost capital advantage via “ Green PV Bonds ”: TERI suggests a dedicated Green PV Bond pool to on-lend at 4–5%, improving bankability of capital-intensive fabs/equipment purchases. Innovation clusters + pilot fabs to leapfrog technology: Proposed Solar Manufacturing Technology Parks with shared testing labs/clean rooms/pilot fabs can speed commercialisation (as seen in global cluster precedents cited). Circularity and ESG-driven new markets : Report outlines stakeholder roadmap and calls for PV recycling associations, take-back programs and ESG-linked financing—opening a new Indian cleantech industry layer.

Key challenges:

Over-reliance on imported upstream inputs and concentrated global supply: With China holding ~98% wafer and ~92% polysilicon share, any disruption can hit India’s deployment/manufacturing continuity. Cost of capital + risk perception for upstream fabs: TERI explicitly notes the need for risk-sharing tools and concessional structures (NIIF/DFIs/hedges) because normal financing is too expensive for mega plants. Equipment/tool-chain chokepoints and FX exposure: The report recommends a cross-currency hedge facility (via RBI/SBI concept) because equipment imports expose fabs to rupee depreciation and project instability. Sustainability compliance and end-of-life management gaps: It calls for take-back programs, industry recycling associations, and decommissioning planning—implying current recycling infrastructure is insufficient for scale.

Way ahead:

Create upstream-ready ecosystems via Solar Manufacturing Technology Parks: Set up parks in PV-heavy states (e.g., Gujarat, Tamil Nadu) with shared labs/clean rooms/pilot fabs to cut time-to-market for new processes. Deploy “Green PV Bonds” + blended finance for scale: Use Green PV Bonds and NIIF/DFI blended finance to lower borrowing costs and crowd-in private equity for polysilicon/wafer/glass/equipment. Build a PV–Semicon workforce pipeline: Establish a dedicated Skill Council to accredit modular training via ITIs/polytechnics/corporate academies and publish a rolling 10-year roadmap aligned to capacity targets. Mainstream circularity: TERI notes MNRE has identified PV recycling as a priority and proposes consortia for recovery of silicon/silver/glass plus state-level pilot take-back programs.

Conclusion:

India must now move beyond modules to build upstream capacity, equipment, and finance. TERI’s roadmap of parks, skills, and blended finance cuts import risks and boosts competitiveness. This can anchor Atmanirbhar cleantech with jobs, resilience, and exports.

Subject: Science and Technology

Context: The Government of India has announced that Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology will be rolled out nationwide by end-2026 to reduce road crashes.

About Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technology :

What it is?

V2V is a wireless communication system that allows vehicles to directly exchange data with nearby vehicles without relying on mobile networks, enabling cars to “talk to each other” in real time.

Aim:

Prevent collisions and pile-ups by giving vehicles real-time warnings about sudden braking, speed changes and nearby traffic.

Improve safety in blind-spot and low-visibility conditions by alerting drivers about hidden, stationary or fog-covered vehicles.

How it works?

Each vehicle will have a small SIM-like device installed inside it. This device allows the vehicle to send and receive signals from nearby vehicles.

As the car moves, it keeps sharing information such as its location, speed, direction, and whether it is braking or accelerating. At the same time, it also receives the same information from other vehicles around it.

All this communication happens using a special radio frequency band (5.875–5.905 GHz) approved by the Department of Telecommunications, so it works even without mobile internet.

If the system detects that another vehicle is too close, suddenly braking, or approaching from a blind spot, it instantly warns the driver. In vehicles with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), these alerts can also help the car automatically slow down or avoid danger.

Key features:

360-degree communication: Alerts come from all directions — front, rear and sides.

Alerts come from all directions — front, rear and sides. Real-time safety alerts: Warns about nearby moving, slow, or stationary vehicles, even beyond the driver’s line of sight.
