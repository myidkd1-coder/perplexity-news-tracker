The Roman god Janus, for whom the month of January is named, has two faces: one looks back to the past while the other looks forward to the future. Janus was the most important of Roman deities, symbolizing both endings and beginnings.

The imagery of two faces, looking in opposite directions, resonated as I gathered my thoughts on the economic outlook. Tariffs, curbs on immigration and the recent escalation in geopolitical tensions harken to the past, while AI and how it might upend current business models could determine the future.

The AI boom and the wealth it has generated have powered the overall economy forward but failed to deliver on other investments and job gains. Firms held back on hiring and shed jobs as uncertainty spiked, amidst shifts to trade and immigration policy.

Inequality intensified with the fate of the economy concentrated in fewer firms and households. Recent work by the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank suggests that the top 20% of earners accounted for a record-breaking 57% of consumer spending through the first half of 2025. The bottom 80% struggled to make ends meet.

Employment slowed to the weakest pace since 2020. It was the second worst year for job gains since the global financial crisis in 2009; we expect it to be revised lower.

Consumers are not pleased. Consumer confidence dropped to recession levels again in December. Concern about both inflation and the labor market moved up in tandem for the first time since the 1970s. Inflation is a regressive tax; it hits low- and middle-income households the hardest.

Even the Federal Reserve was flummoxed. It cut interest rates for the third time in as many meetings in December. The vote was contentious.

This edition of Economic Compass takes a closer look at the outlook for 2026, paying special attention to the weakness in the labor market, what is causing it and the outlook for inflation. The economy enters the year with a tailwind, but those gains will not ease the tension between inflation and unemployment.

Bond markets have grown skittish; investors are not buying what the Fed is selling. Bond yields have moved up since the Fed resumed its cutting cycle. That is worrisome on many levels, including the backdrop of escalating geopolitical tensions. Gold has regained its luster as a safe haven at the expense of US Treasuries.

NOTE: The forecast assumes that the Fed retains its relative independence and does not overstimulate. Historically, such moves have added to inflation, pushed up bond yields and undermined the credit-worthiness of the countries that pursued such policies.
