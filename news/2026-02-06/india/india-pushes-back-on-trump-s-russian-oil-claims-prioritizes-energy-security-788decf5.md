## Full Article
India has pushed back firmly against U.S. claims that it will stop buying Russian oil amid a new trade deal with Washington, insisting that energy security for 1.4 billion Indians is its “supreme priority.” New Delhi’s Ministry of External Affairs said decisions on crude imports are driven by market realities, not political pressure, and that it remains open to commercially viable options — including Venezuelan oil — while continuing to protect national energy needs. Russia has also reiterated that India is free to source oil from anywhere. In the evolving global energy and geopolitical landscape, India’s balancing act between the U.S., Russia, and other producers underscores a new phase of diplomatic and economic strategic autonomy.
