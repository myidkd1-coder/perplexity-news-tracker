For the chocoholics out there (Image credit: Sweet Robo) This 3D printer comes with a bit of a difference – instead of printing spare parts for your gaming handheld, or a new spoon handle, it's capable of making a chocolate treat in any shape you fancy. The ChocoPrint is actually a vending machine with the ability to print a chocolate bar in a design of your choosing. That could be a logo or your name. Debuting at CES, it will likely be making its way into sweet shops sometime in the coming year. Sadly, you won't be able to get one for the corner of your bedroom (unless you have a bundle of cash to spare).

IKEA wants to light up your life (Image credit: Future) IKEA has used its first appearance at CES to unveil a new, smarter version of its Varmblixt light. It's essentially taking on the likes of Philips Hue and Govee with a lamp that offers 12 shades of light, curated by designer Sabine Marcelis. You get a remote control to switch between them and can dim the output to any level you like. It'll go on sale in April, priced at $99.99 in the US. Other regions are to follow.

Watch out Steam Deck, Lenovo is coming for you (Image credit: Lenovo) The Steam Deck has long been everyone's favourite PC gaming handheld, but the crown is wobbling. First, the Lenovo Legion Go S SteamOS edition arrived to provide a more powerful alternative, and now the brand has announced a Steam-powered version of its flagship device – the Lenovo Legion Go 2 SteamOS. Sporting an 8.8-inch OLED display, Z2 Extreme processing and up to 2TB SSD, there's no doubt that this new handheld is a monster. And it could finally be the device that prompts Valve to consider a Steam Deck 2. You'd better check your bank balance though, as while we've not yet got a price, you should expect it to start around £1,000.

Bionic boots? Yes, please (Image credit: Delphy) The Delphy Sidekick has been announced at CES and it could be a major step in the right direction for bionics – pun entirely intended. You strap the robotic devices to your ankles and they'll aid you in walking further and faster than ever before. Maybe all the way to your bank to explain why you've suddenly got a $4,500 hole in your finances.

Yes, there really is a robovac on legs (Image credit: Roborock) We've seen robot vacuum cleaners that can climb stairs before (at last year's CES, in fact) but this new model from Roborock really looks the business. The brnd has previously created a model that can pick up socks with a robotic arm, but the Roborock Sarous Rover could be the answer to complicated home vacuuming needs. It has two legs on wheels, so not only can it whizz around your floors easily, it can even jump. It's currently in development at present, so there's no word yet on availability, but it's definitely one to look out for (during the robot uprising to take over our planet).

Serious competition for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (Image credit: Future / Mike Lowe) Motorola and its parent brand Lenovo have announced a whole tonne of new products at CES, and we'll be bringing you more on those later. For now though, tech editor Mike Lowe managed to get his hands on arguably the most exciting of those – especially for those looking for an alternative to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. The Motorola Razr Fold is the company's first book-style foldable, having produced clamshell slip phones for the last few years. It's a 6.6-inch device that unfolds into an 8.1-inch tablet and it looks great. It's months away from release, so the software isn't yet final, but what's really interesting is that it is compatible with the Moto Pen Ultra stylus. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 does not work with the S Pen, with Samsung dropping support for its latest generation.

Great news for existing Philips Hue bulb owners (Image credit: Philips Hue) Although it usually has some tech innovations to share at CES, Philips Hue has concentrated on existing users with this year's big announcement. As long as you own a Hue Bridge Pro, you will soon be able to make use of a new Hue SpatialAware feature. This analyses your room, works out where all your bulbs and supported lighting solutions are, then suggests personalised scenes you can use.

HP's made a computer in a keyboard (Image credit: Future) It may or may not end up shifting huge numbers of units, but the HP EliteBoard G1a remains one of the oddest devices we've seen from a major brand here at CES 2026. HP took a mini PC and basically crammed it under a keyboard to effectively invent a new type of product category. We went hands-on at a preview event in December, and found it really impressive. There are still obvious questions about whether it can actually outmatch normal mini PCs, but who knows, maybe we'll all be using them in a few years.

Amazfit wants to watch you eat (Image credit: Amazfit) Although it's just a concept for now, Amazfit has proposed a device that will watch what you eat and then give you advice on your lifestyle options. The V1TAL Food Camera could analyse your eating behaviour and link it to your training, recovery, and health data inside the Zepp app. That way you won't have log every item and calorie separately. Let's hope it's made into a full product soon, even if it does sound a little creepy.

Move over Amazon, Razer is coming for Alexa (Image credit: Razer) Mostly known for its high-end gaming laptops and accessories, Razer has announced that it will introduce an Echo-style smart assistant device later this year – and it'll come with a holographic screen on the front. The AVA assistant will be AI-powered and is designed as a desktop companion. You'll be able to ask it whatever you want, and use it for normal everyday activities, but it'll also help you with gaming tips and eSports-level advice.

Xbox Cloud Gaming heading to more TVs (Image credit: Rik Henderson / Future) Microsoft's plans to turn everything into an Xbox will be greatly expanded this year. It has announced partnership deals with new manufacturers to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to their TVs. This is said to include Google TV models, with TCL's flagship Mini LED TV said to be getting the service, as well as Hisense sets. It has announced that it's teaming up with V (aka VIDAA) to bring cloud gaming to all Smart TVs powered by the V homeOS platform. We're also waiting to see if other manufacturers will be getting the Google TV app – if so, that will open up Xbox Game Pass play on a wide range of other devices, such as Philips and Sony models. Fingers crossed.

Surprise announcements from Amazon (Image credit: Amazon) While Amazon hasn't technically made its new announcements at CES 2026, it has timed several interesting Fire TV news snippets to coincide with the show. For starters, it has unveiled a new TV – the Amazon Ember Artline, which will compete with Samsung's The Frame and other lifestyle models available from rival brands. In addition, it has confirmed that Fire TV devices are getting their biggest upgrade in half a decade, with a new user experience to roll out to Fire TV Sticks and TVs from February. On top of that, all Amazon Fire TVs will be rebranded Amazon Ember going forward.

Should you care about Intel's new chips? Absolutely (Image credit: Future) Intel's presentation is now over and we've been running around getting a look at some of the many laptops it's showcasing that'll have its chips in the coming months. In fact, the first ones will be available from tomorrow, so this is very much current news. The Panther Lake chips (or Core Ultra Series 3, officially) bring major gains in power efficiency, making for way better battery life compared to the last generation. They also have really impressive integrated graphics. To learn more, check out our breaking news piece here.

HP's having fun with those new Intel chips (Image credit: Future) HP is one of the many laptop-makers finally able to talk about new machines now that Intel has unveiled its Panther Lake chips, and I saw one of its sexiest laptops in New York back in December. The new Omnibook Ultra is seriously gorgeous, with a beautiful, thin and light design that really won me over when I got to handle it for a while. Check out my full story on the machine right here for more details.

Dell admits it was wrong – hallelujah, the XPS is back (Image credit: Dell) It's bafflingly rare to see a brand of Dell's size admit it made a mistake, let alone as quickly as a year later. Just 12 months on from its bombshell announcement at the last CES that it was killing off beloved sub-brands to supposedly streamline its laptop lineup, Dell is immediately reviving the XPS and admitting its mistake. It actually isn't the biggest change in hardware terms, but we're completely jazzed to see the beloved brand return. Learn more about it in our full piece, right here.

Acer's MacBook Air competitor has a game-changing trackpad If you want to make a new laptop stand out, you might think that including the latest Intel chip would be a good place to start – and you'd be right. Still, there are quite a few machines being announced at this CES to tick that box, so it's good news that Acer has more up its sleeve. Its new Acer Swift 16 AI has the world's largest haptic touchpad – at 175.5 x 109.7mm. That's a huge amount of control to exert as you use the laptop, and it's got us very excited indeed.

Intel's new chips are about to arrive Intel's about to take centre stage here at CES, with the announcement of its latest generation of chips (codenamed Panther Lake). That's a big deal for basically every major laptop-maker under the sun, too, and we're in the theatre to see what's what. Good news, though: you can watch along at home if you want to find everything out in real time, with the below livestream.

Lego Star Wars Plays Back! (Image credit: Lego) Lego has released what it's calling Smart Play; a smart tech system that uses a Smart Brick to provide sound and effects to your Lego sets. It's a massive development for Lego and has huge potential. Read more in the article.

Build it and they will come (Image credit: Future) Lego's big CES conference is about to start. All the details coming soon

Fender finally sees a future beyond guitars (Image credit: Fender) It's taken a while, but Fender has finally decided to launch its own wireless headphones. The Fender Mix over-ears sport active noise cancellation and 52 hours of battery life, but perhaps the most interesting feature is the ability to swap different elements. That creates a modular design that's in line with the company's guitar design. It's claimed they'll cost around $300.

A handy robot helper arrives (Image credit: LG) The day we've always dreamed of has arrived – sort of. LG is showing CLOiD during CES, with the household robot allegedly able to fold laundry and even put your dinner in the oven. It's AI-powered (of course) and looks slightly like the PlayStation hero Astro Bot. But it's interesting to note that rather than just a fancy tech demo, the droid is capable of doing several different chores, not just the one.

Samsung set for a big Z Fold rival soon (Image credit: Evan Blass) Motorola is attending CES this year and it could have something rather special up its sleeve – according to a prominent leaker. It is claimed that it will add a new Razr foldable phone to its line-up, and it will take on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Info on the device has been posted online by Evan Blass in the last week, but now he also claims that the Motorola Razr Fold will be announced at CES within hours. We'll bring you all the latest as soon as we have it.

Now this is exactly what smart fridges needed (Image credit: GE Appliances) Smart fridges are great for planning meals, etc, especially when they include a display, but does that really improve your life? When I first heard about smart refrigerators many years ago, I always imagined that they would be able to track the products you put in them, to alert you when you need to buy the essentials as part of your weekly food shop. It's taken a while but GE Appliances has taken a significant step in this direction. It has announced a new flagship fridge that includes a barcode scanner so you can keep track of everything inside. And so, when you're in the supermarket you can check on the app which foodstuffs you have and which you've run out of. Nice.

LG's Wallpaper TV is back (Image credit: Future / Mike Lowe) LG first debuted its Wallpaper TV almost a decade ago, but the superthin display that sits almost flush to a wall was discontinued in 2020. Now it's back, with an all-new model shown at CES 2026, and we're suitably impressed. Tech editor Mike Lowe saw the OLED W6 at a pre-CES event in Las Vegas this weekend, and not only does it feature the latest panel, the only physical connection it needs is power – everything else is supplied wirelessly.

IKEA and Lego to debut at the show (Image credit: IKEA) While the major brands are set to unveil their latest and greatest at the show, this year's CES will see the debut of a few companies not usually associated with the world of consumer electronics. IKEA is a surprising exhibitor this year, for example, and will show off a whole range of different gadgets and smart home devices. It's already hitting the headlines with its cheap-as-chips Qi2 chargers and USB-C adapter, but we expect to find out more on its 2026 lineup very soon. And Lego will host its own press conference from Las Vegas later today – at 10am PT (6pm GMT). We'll bring you all the news on its announcement as it happens.

130-inch Micro RGB revealed (Image credit: Samsung) Samsung's new R95H is a 130-inch TV that uses Micro RGB technology to deliver OLED level performance. The massive TV is also a huge design statement, with a floating design.

Samsung CES keynote starts (Image credit: Future) We're at the Samsung press conference to bring you the first look at the 2026 products from this tech giant. The talk is definitely AI-focused, making it a true companion for users.

Plaud heads to the desktop (Image credit: Plaud) Plaud stood out in the AI transcription and summary market this year with its physical devices – a Plaud Note / Note Pro and Plaud NotePin. Now, though it has a version of its software built for the desktop, and it's free to Plaud Subscribers. Plaud Desktop can auto-detect when meetings start and record from a wide range of video conferencing apps to provide you with an audio file, transcription and an extensive summary.

Finding the sun itself (Image credit: Jackery) Jackery's new Solar Mars Bot is a portable power station that can seek out the best sun for its solar panels, thanks to the fact it's on wheels. The roaming robot features four extending solar panels and will autonomously find the best spot to help it to charge.

Clicks has recreated the BlackBerry (Image credit: Clicks) After successfully selling two generations of the Clicks Keyboard for iPhone, which added a BlackBerry-like manual keyboard to your phone, Clicks have launched an actual phone. And, unsurprisingly, it looks a bit like a BlackBerry. The Clicks Communicator is no retro handset though, bringing modern tech but in a more manual way and less distractions.

Laptops will be a major theme (Image credit: LG) It's too early for any official news, but with the knowledge that AMD, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm are all present at CES, with their respective conferences throughout Monday 5th and Tuesday 6th January, it's clear that we're going to get a lot of processor reveals at the show. And that means a lot of laptops. LG has gone early with its Gram reveal. But there'll be a presence from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, Samsung, Razer, MSI and many more. Pretty much any major laptop-maker you can think of will have new kit – featuring the latest processors. The rumour is that we're not talking top-end, though. This is mass-market, AI-forward, affordable processors for the kind of laptops that most people will want to buy. And with Nvidia not expected the reveal an upgraded GPU this CES, that also fits the narrative.

In brief: When is CES 2026? (Image credit: Future) While CES 2026 officially takes place from Tuesday 6th through until Saturday 10th January this year, the days preceding the show's official opening is when many reveals happen – and the big news begins to drop. Indeed, Sunday 4th and Monday 5th January this year are the two media preview days, where we can expect much of the heavy reveals to happen. That plus some behind-the-scenes pre-briefings under embargo. CES 2026: What to expect? While CES has often been seen as a TV or audio-video showcase, it's no longer just about the best new TVs – sure, LG, Samsung, Hisense and TCL will reveals their latest, but there'll be plenty more too. This year the big press conferences is from Lenovo (at the Las Vegas Sphere), suggesting that PC, gaming and AI will be big – and with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm and Nvidia all also present and with their own big reveals, that makes a lot of sense. It's also Lego's first-ever CES, which is a great example of the show's reach beyond the norms. That plus some automotive presence, lots of audio brands (in the Venetian Sands expo), and a lean towards AI and health tech continue to be rising trends.
