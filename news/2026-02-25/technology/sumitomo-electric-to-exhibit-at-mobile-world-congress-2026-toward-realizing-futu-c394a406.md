## Summary
Sumitomo Electric will showcase next-generation communication technologies at MWC 2026, including 5G millimeter wave DASs, industrial 5G edge AI terminals for low-latency factory data processing with AI image compression, and APN transceivers for high-capacity, low-latency 6G networks.

## Full Article
Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. will exhibit its next-generation communication technologies—a high-speed, high-capacity millimeter wave communication system and an all-optical network transceiver (APN*¹ transceiver)—at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2026, the world's largest mobile communications exhibition, to be held in Barcelona, Spain from March 2 (Monday) to 5 (Thursday), 2026.



MWC is a prestigious event organized by the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), which brings together mobile operators and equipment manufacturers from around the world. Attracting over 100,000 attendees each year, it serves as a platform for showcasing the latest technologies and emerging market trends.



At our booth within the Japan Pavilion, we will showcase innovative solutions for future communication infrastructure, including 6G and APN, such as millimeter wave-based distributed antenna systems (DASs), industrial 5G edge AI terminals, and APN transceivers, and will conduct live demonstrations. We are looking forward to your visit to our booth for a hands-on approach to the latest technologies.
