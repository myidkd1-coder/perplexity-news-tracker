‘Tis the season for last-minute shopping and Mariah Carey to emerge from hibernation, so here’s our Christmas edition of This Week In Entertainment News.

Though the news from Hollywood is far from jolly, with famed director Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner allegedly murdered by their son Nick. The bodies of Rob and Michele were discovered in their Los Angeles home by their daughter Romy Reiner.

Nick Reiner, 32 has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing his parents. It is a shocking crime that has rocked the Hollywood community and left many in disbelief. An acclaimed actor and director, Rob Reiner was also a prominent supporter of many liberal political causes as well as a harsh and outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.

President Trump has been criticised for what was deemed an insensitive post about Rob Reiner following his death, stating he and Michele passed away: “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.”

Former US President Brack Obama was among the many others offering tributes to Rob and Michele.

“Rob’s achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,” he said in a statement. “But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people – and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.”

Among Rob Reiner’s many cinematic achievements are classic films such as ‘When Harry Met Sally’, ‘The Princess Bride’, ‘Stand By Me’, ‘Misery’, and ‘This Is Spinal Tap’. He had recently released the highly anticipated sequel, ‘This Is Spinal Tap II’. His filmography also includes a long list of on-screen film and television credits, featuring in ‘All In The Family’, ‘New Girl’, ‘The Wolf of Wall Street’ and many more.

After being controversially axed in October, Robin Bailey and her breakfast co-hosts have been reinstated and will to KIIS FM. It’s a surprising backflip that will see the popular trio of Robin, Kip Wightman and Corey Oates back on the airwaves in 2026 following strong feedback from listeners, according to the station.

Perennial rockers AC/DC have given Brisbane a heavy dose of high-voltage rock and roll on their ‘PWR/UP’ tour, delivering two powerful sets that brought the faithful to their knees. Their first shows here in over a decade did not disappoint, filling Suncorp Stadium with iconic rock anthems that left ears ringing all over the city.

In yet another blow to Australia’s flailing festival economy, Parkway Drive have announced the cancellation of the Park Waves Australia tour. It was to be the Australian debut for the band’s bespoke metal festival, which has already had success in Europe. However, economic factors have cited among the reasons for the cancellation, signalling just how badly our live music industry is struggling.

Scheduled for February 2026, Park Waves was set to be headlined by Parkway Drive alongside The Amity Affliction, Northlane, Alpha Wolf and international act Story Of The Year. The 11-date run included stops in Adelaide, Geelong, Scoresby, Bendigo, Wollongong, Eastern Creek, Maitland, Toowoomba, Byron Bay and Sandstone Point. Ticketholders are eligible for a full refund, including booking fees.

Word on the street is legendary punk ban Social Distortion are releasing a new album, their first in 15 years. The long-awaited follow-up to 2011’s ‘Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes’ is due to drop in May 2026, confirmed by frontman Mike Ness. The first single from the album is expected in January. It’s also the first new music since Mike was diagnosed with tonsil cancer in 2023. After extensive treatment and rehabilitation, Ness says his voice is now stronger than ever.

Get ready for Scots who rock when Biffy Clyro return to Australia in 2026 after an eight-year absence. It seems longer than that, but the band is on their way for a tour in April for their new album ‘Futique’, visiting Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, with tickets selling fast. Biffy Clyro have built a strong fanbase in Australia that has endured while they’ve been away.

Aussie art-rock unit Regurgitator present a 30-year retrospective on the upcoming Australian tour, playing more than 30 dates across the country. Running from February to May 2026, the ‘JUKEBOXXIN’’ tour sees the ‘Gurge perform all the classic tracks and fan favourites from over the years. If songs like ‘Polyester Girl’, ! (The Song Formerly Known As), and ‘Kong Foo Sing’ still give you the feels, these shows are for you.

The first crop of artists performing at the Gympie Music Muster in 2026 have been revealed, presenting a curated lineup of living legends and emerging artists. Among them are greats such as Lee Kernaghan, Adam Eckersley Band, James Blundell, Nathan Cavleri and 2026 festival ambassador Amber Lawrence.

They join up and comers like Brooke Schubert, Cass Eager, James Johnston, Taylor Moss, Sara Berki and more. Gympie Music Muster is one of the region’s biggest tourism drawcards, attracting thousands of Australian and international visitors.
