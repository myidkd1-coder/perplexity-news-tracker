## Summary
Recent study leverages AI to identify gut microbiome patterns associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Additional findings link higher grip strength in older women to lower mortality, and explore indoor air quality impacts on respiratory health.

Grip strength links to longer life in women over 60

In a cohort of 5,472 ambulatory women aged 63–99 from the WHI-OPACH study, higher grip strength was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality over 8.3 years, even after adjusting for accelerometer-measured physical activity, sedentary time, fitness proxy, body composition, and inflammation.
