How credit cards work

Credit cards are financial products that are similar to unsecured loans (except for secured credit cards). You're approved based on your credit history, income and other factors. Once approved, you can make purchases with your new credit card. As long as you pay off your full credit card balance by your statement due date, you won't pay interest. However, with credit cards, you are only required to make a minimum payment each month to avoid late payment fees or penalty APRs (charge cards work differently and typically must be paid off each month). If you pay less than your entire balance, you'll pay interest on the charges you carry over from month to month. In addition to interest charges, credit cards can have other fees, such as annual fees, foreign transaction fees and fees for late or returned payments.

Different types of credit cards

There are different classes of credit cards designed for various types of people. Some cards are easier to qualify for and can be good options if you have poor credit or no credit. Other cards can only be used for purchases with a specific merchant. Rewards credit cards Rewards credit cards are some of the most popular cards. These cards earn points, miles or cash back and usually offer the best benefits and perks. Most co-branded credit cards are also rewards credit cards, including airline credit cards and hotel credit cards. Secured credit cards If you don't have the credit score needed to get approved for the most lucrative cards, a secured credit card is a good starting point. You typically don't need a credit score, and you can qualify with poor credit because secured credit cards require an upfront deposit. Your credit limit is based on the size of your security deposit. Some secured cards also offer a path to upgrade to an unsecured credit card and have your deposit refunded. Charge cards Charge cards are a type of credit card that doesn't have a predetermined spending limit. Instead, you must pay off the balance of a charge card in full each month. If you miss a payment, you could be stuck paying a hefty fee. Charge cards may earn rewards, just like credit cards. Store cards Store cards are a type of co-branded card that can only be used at that specific store, such as Best Buy, Home Depot or Target. These cards can offer benefits such as discounts, extended returns or deferred interest financing. Since you cannot use these cards for everyday purchases, they typically only make sense as supplementary cards.

How to evaluate a credit card's value

Credit cards are as varied as the people who apply for them, so the first step in finding the best credit card is knowing what you need. You'll also want to carefully consider the costs and benefits of each card that you think is a good fit for you. Upfront benefits Many credit cards offer additional value to entice you to apply for the card. Common upfront perks include welcome bonuses, additional limited-time rewards, companion passes, free night certificates and intro APR offers. The value of these perks can far exceed the cost of a card's annual fee, but it's important to understand that these are one-time perks. Ongoing benefits What makes a card worth keeping is its ongoing perks. The rewards you earn and the additional benefits are where you'll typically get the most value. This could be in the form of elite status, elite status credit, statement credits, travel protections, shopping protections and bonuses for hitting spending thresholds. The key to making a credit card's ongoing benefits work for you is knowing whether you'll use the perks consistently. Fees and APR Having a credit card can easily become an expensive endeavor. Some of the top credit cards have annual fees, and the annual fee associated with premium credit cards can top $700. There can also be fees for balance transfers, cash advances, late payments, returned payments and transactions you make in a foreign currency. If you're not aware of these, the cost of using a credit card can quickly outpace its value. If you don't pay off your card balance in full each month, you'll be assessed interest. Paying interest on credit card debt isn't ideal because your APR can easily exceed 20%, which makes it one of the most expensive financing options.

How to choose a credit card

With so many options available, it can be hard to find the best credit card for your needs. Here are a few questions to ask yourself to help you decide which card is best for you. How much will you earn? There are hundreds of rewards credit cards that let you earn cash back, points, or miles on every purchase. Many earn additional rewards in specific categories, while others provide an elevated return across the board. Common bonus spending categories include gas, groceries, restaurants, and travel. Other cards are simple and earn flat-rate rewards. To get an idea of how your rewards vary depending on the card, let's take a look at what you could earn with the Citi Double Cash® Card compared to the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. The Double Cash earns 2% cash back on every purchase (1% when you pay and 1% when you buy). The cash back you receive is earned as Citi ThankYou® Points (1 cent = 1 point). The Sapphire Preferred earns 5X points on Chase TravelSM travel bookings, 3X points on dining, 3X points on select streaming services, 3X points on online grocery shopping, 2X points on other travel purchases and 1X points everywhere else. It also comes with a 10% points bonus every card anniversary, and you'll earn 1 bonus point for every dollar you spend on your Sapphire Preferred card that year. Here's what you'd earn with each card based on an example budget of $2,800 a month, broken down as follows: $500 for groceries (not online): Double Cash : 1,000 points

: 1,000 points Sapphire Preferred: 500 points $350 for dining: Double Cash: 700 points

700 points Sapphire Preferred: 1,050 points $200 for travel (not booked through Chase TravelSM): Double Cash: 400 points

400 points Sapphire Preferred: 400 points $40 for streaming services: Double Cash: 80 points

80 points Sapphire Preferred: 120 points $1,710 on other purchases: Double Cash: 3,420 points

3,420 points Sapphire Preferred: 1,710 points Each month, you'd earn 5,600 points with the Double Cash and 3,780 points with the Sapphire Preferred. If you did all of your grocery shopping online (1,000 additional points) and factored in the Sapphire Preferred's annual 10% points bonus (280 points per month awarded on your account anniversary), the Sapphire Preferred would still earn less than the Double Cash. However, just because it earns fewer points in this scenario doesn't mean the Sapphire Preferred is less valuable. Credit card rewards have different usefulness and value that need to be considered.

What credit score do I need to get the best cards?

When you apply for a credit card, the bank or lender will review your credit report from one or more of the three major credit bureaus. It will also typically check your FICO credit score, the top credit cards usually require a very good or excellent credit score. This is how FICO credit scores are classified according to myFICO: Poor/bad credit: Less than 580

Less than 580 Fair credit: 580-669

580-669 Good credit: 670-739

670-739 Very good credit: 740-799

740-799 Exceptional/excellent credit: 800 or higher Building and maintaining a healthy credit score helps your personal finances in all sorts of ways outside of increasing your chances of getting approved for a great sign-up bonus. Your FICO score is calculated based on the following factors and each is weighted differently: Payment history: 35%

35% Total debt: 30%

30% Length of credit history: 15%

15% New credit: 10%

10% Credit mix: 10%

How to apply for a credit card

While specific restrictions can apply depending on the card and card issuers, applying for a credit card is easy. You'll often get an instant decision on whether you're approved or denied, and sometimes you can get instant access to your credit card. To apply for a credit card, you'll usually need to be 18 years old and provide the following: Full legal name

Date of birth

Social Security number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)

Mailing address

Email address and/or phone number

Annual income

Housing costs If you're applying for a business card, the process is similar, but you'll need to provide additional information, including the business name, address, tax ID and income.

FAQs How many credit cards should I have? Many people have multiple credit cards, and there are benefits to this. It can help increase your credit score by giving you more available credit and therefore a better credit utilization ratio. You can also earn more rewards by optimizing which card you use for certain spending categories. For instance, you may make all your dining purchases with a card that earns bonus rewards in that category, but another card with a bonus multiplier for grocery purchases. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how many credit cards you need. Make sure to evaluate your spending habits and research which card would be best for you. How old do I have to be to get a credit card? The minimum age to open a credit card on your own is 18. However, it is possible to get a credit card as a minor by being added as an authorized user on someone else's account. What is the easiest credit card to get? Secured credit cards are generally the easiest credit cards to be approved for. They are similar to traditional cards (they extend credit, can incur interest charges and in some cases can even earn rewards) but require you to put down a security deposit to access a line of credit. The amount you deposit usually becomes your credit limit. Which type of card is most accepted? There are four major credit card payment networks: American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa. Visa and Mastercard are the most widely accepted credit card networks globally. That said, American Express and Discover still have 99% acceptance rates among U.S. merchants who take credit cards and are increasing their international footprints. What is a credit card's billing cycle? When it comes to credit cards, most billing cycles are one month or 28 to 31 days. After your billing cycle ends, you typically have what is known as a grace period, where you can pay off your full balance without incurring any interest charges. However, if you pay off your card balance before the billing cycle ends, it will help to keep your credit utilization down, which boosts your credit score. Keep in mind that the grace period may not apply to all charges. Balance transfers and cash advances are usually charged interest starting on the transaction date. Do I need a business credit card? Having a separate credit card for your small business or side hustle is important so you can keep your personal and business activities separate. Business credit cards come in all shapes and sizes, there are business cards that offer cash back rewards, travel rewards and everything in between. The right business credit card for you should offer bonus rewards that align with your business spending. To keep it simple, you can start your business credit card search at the bank where you currently have your business bank accounts. If you bank with Wells Fargo, Bank of America or Chase, it may be easiest to have all your accounts with one institution.

Our methodology

To determine to the top cards, CNBC Select analyzed over 250 major credit cards issued through FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions that are widely available in the U.S. We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).
