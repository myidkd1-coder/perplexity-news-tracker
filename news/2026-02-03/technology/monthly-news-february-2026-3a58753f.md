Monthly news - February 2026 Edition

This is our monthly "What's new" blog post, summarizing product updates and various new assets we released over the past month across our Defender products. In this edition, we are looking at all the goodness from January 2026. Defender for Cloud has its own Monthly News post, have a look here.

🚀 New Virtual Ninja Show episode:

Microsoft Defender

(Public Preview) Microsoft Defender now supports Entra Agent IDs! Microsoft Entra Agent ID extends the comprehensive security capabilities of Microsoft Entra to agents, enabling organizations to build, discover, govern, and protect agent identities. Until now agents use User OBO (User on behalf of), but now you can specify an Entra agent ID, a dedicated identity for your agents. Learn more about Entra Agent IDs here.

(Public Preview) The BehaviorInfo and BehaviorEntities tables in advanced hunting now include additional columns and information about behavior data types and alerts from User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), providing more insights on the relationships between identified behaviors and entities. Learn more about UEBA behaviors

(Public Preview) Streamline Incident Management with Microsoft Defender’s New Built-In Alert Tuning Rules. Built‑in alert tuning rules help SOC teams focus on high‑quality, actionable incidents that reflect real threats - while automatically handling informational and low‑severity alerts in the background.

At Microsoft Ignite last November, we announced a new capability in Microsoft Defender designed to solve exactly this problem: AI-powered incident prioritization. Today, we’re excited to share that AI-powered incident prioritization is now available in public preview for all Microsoft Defender customers! This is about helping SOC teams cut through noise, focus on what matters most, and move faster with confidence. Read more details in this blog post.

(Public Preview) In advanced hunting, if the query result exceeds the 64-MB size limit, the portal now returns the maximum number of records it can within this limit and displays a message indicating that the displayed results are partial due to size constraints. Learn more.

(Public Preview) Alert tuning set as behavior - reclassifies certain alerts as behaviors so they don’t appear in the open alerts queue or generate incidents - yet remain available for investigation and hunting when needed.

Updated date: Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure portal to be retired March 2027. Microsoft Sentinel is generally available in the Microsoft Defender portal, including for customers without Microsoft Defender XDR or an E5 license. This means that you can use Microsoft Sentinel in the Defender portal even if you aren't using other Microsoft Defender services. After March 31, 2027, Microsoft Sentinel will no longer be supported in the Azure portal and will be available only in the Microsoft Defender portal. Learn more in this blog post and get useful resources.

(General Availability) The option to disable incident correlation for analytics rules is now general available. Learn more about it here.

(Public Preview) Content distribution in Defender's multi-tenant management now supports the distribution of Analytics Rules, Automation Rules, and Workbooks. This allows multi-tenant customers to quickly onboard new tenants and maintain a consistent security baseline. Read the blog to learn more.

Blog post: Accelerate your move to Microsoft Sentinel with the new AI Powered SIEM migration experience.

(Public Preview) You can now enable UEBA for supported data sources directly from the data connector configuration page, reducing management time and preventing coverage gaps.

(Public Preview) UEBA behaviors layer aggregates actionable insights from raw logs in near-real time. Microsoft Sentinel introduces a UEBA behaviors layer that transforms high-volume, low-level security logs into clear, human-readable behavioral insights in the Defender portal. This AI-powered capability aggregates and sequences raw events from supported data sources into normalized behaviors that explain "who did what to whom" with MITRE ATT&CK context. Learn more here.

(Public Preview) The Triage MCP is a collection (server) on the Sentinel MCP platform and provides access to a set of APIs that enable incident and alert triage. You can use these tools to carry out autonomous triage and investigation, or build your own agentic workflows, on top of Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Sentinel alerts and incidents.
