It’s finally the end of February and as we shift over to March, it’s time for new movies and television shows to hit streaming platforms for the new month. Other platforms, like Netflix and Peacock, have already unveiled their monthly additions and now it’s Prime Video’s turn with the streamer letting subscribers know what entertainment they can look forward to as winter gives way to spring. At first glance, March is shaping up to be a good month for fans of some older movies, but there’s at least one big television release fans will be particularly excited about.
