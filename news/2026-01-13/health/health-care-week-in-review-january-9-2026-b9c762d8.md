Reports, Studies & Analyses

On December 22, 2025, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report entitled, Nine of Thirty Selected Assisted Living Facilities Did Not Comply With Terms and Conditions and Federal Requirements for Expending Provider Relief Fund Payments. The report examined whether 30 assisted living facilities (ALFs) expended taxpayer funds in accordance with federal and Provider Relief Fund (PRF) program requirements. OIG found that seven ALFs claimed a total of $283,000 in unallowable PRF expenditures, and two ALFs inaccurately reported $11 million in lost revenues. These deficiencies occurred despite ALFs attesting to the PRF terms and conditions and ongoing guidance from HRSA. The ALFs made clerical errors when reporting expenditures, misinterpreted HRSA guidance, did not maintain sufficient documentation to support reported expenditures, and lacked procedures to verify the accuracy of lost revenue calculations. OIG made two recommendations to HRSA, including that it: (1) require the seven ALFs that claimed a total of $283,000 in unallowable PRF expenditures return any unallowable expenditures and lost revenue amounts to the federal government or ensure that the ALFs properly account for these expenditures and lost revenues; and (2) require the two ALFs that inaccurately reported $11 million in lost revenues identify and return any PRF payments used to offset inaccurately calculated lost revenues or replace them with allowable unreimbursed lost revenues or eligible expenses. HRSA concurred with OIG’s recommendations.

On December 23, 2025, OIG released a report entitled, Medicaid Agencies Made Millions in Unallowable Capitation Payments to Managed Care Organizations on Behalf of Deceased Enrollees. OIG assessed the value of Medicaid capitation payments made to managed care organizations (MCOs) on behalf of deceased enrollees. Based on a review of 100 statistically sampled capitation payments, OIG estimated that Medicaid agencies made $207,501,380 in unallowable capitation payments to MCOs for deceased enrollees during the audit period. OIG found that 99 of the 100 sampled payments were made after the enrollee’s death. For 50 of these payments, Medicaid agencies had recovered the overpayments before OIG provided the sample for review. The remaining 49 payments were either not recovered or were recovered only after OIG notified the agencies. As a result, OIG estimated that there was approximately $207,501,380 in unallowable capitation payments during the audit period.



OIG made two recommendations to CMS, including: (1) provide the Medicaid agencies covered by the audit with OIG’s matched Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) data in order to review the capitation payments and take appropriate action to recover any unallowable payments; and (2) identify opportunities to work with Medicaid agencies to ensure that provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are properly implemented. CMS concurred with the first recommendation and did not clearly indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with the second recommendation.

CMS concurred with the first recommendation and did not clearly indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with the second recommendation. On January 5, 2026, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report entitled, Federal Awards: Selected Programs Did Not Fully Include Identified Practices to Enhance Oversight and Fraud Prevention. GAO examined how five federal programs oversee and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in grants, contracts, and loans. The review found that four programs, including HHS’ Health Center Program, did not consistently incorporate all nine requirements and leading practices identified by GAO. GAO outlined several recommendations, including that the HHS Secretary: (1) finalize HHS policies documenting how often programs should conduct fraud risk assessments; (2) ensure that an agencywide risk profile for HHS is documented; (3) ensure that a program-specific risk profile for the Health Center Program is documented; (4) ensure that an anti-fraud strategy for the Health Center Program is documented; and (5) ensure that procedures to monitor fraud risk management activities for the Health Center Program are documented.

Hearings & Markups

On January 8, 2026, the House Energy & Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee held a hearing entitled, Legislative Proposals to Support Patient Access to Medicare Services. Witnesses included: Ms. Susan Van Meter, President, American Clinical Laboratory Association; Ms. Connie Sullivan, President and CEO, National Home Infusion Association; Mr. Thomas Ryan, President and CEO, American Association for Homecare; and Mr. David Lipschutz, JD, Attorney and Co-Director of Law and Policy, Center for Medicare Advocacy. The hearing focuses on several bills, including H.R. 6210, the Senior Savings Protection Act; H.R. 6361, the Ban AI Denials in Medicare Act; H.R. 5243, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to increase data transparency for supplemental benefits under Medicare Advantage; H.R. 2902, the Supplemental Oxygen Access Reform (SOAR) Act of 2025; H.R. 1703, the Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2025; H.R. 2005, the DMEPOS Relief Act of 2025; H.R. 5347, the Health Care Efficiency Through Flexibility Act; H.R. 2172, the Preserving Patient Access to Home Infusion Act; H.R. 2477, the Portable Ultrasound Reimbursement Equity Act of 2025; and H.R. 5269, the Reforming and Enhancing Sustainable Updates to Laboratory Testing Services (RESULTS) Act of 2025.

Other Health Policy News

On December 22, 2025, CMS announced a new drug pricing model for GLP-1 medications in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid programs called the Better Approaches to Lifestyle and Nutrition for Comprehensive hEalth (BALANCE) Model. Under this model, CMS will negotiate directly with participating GLP-1 manufacturers on prices for participating state Medicaid programs and Part D plans. This model will likely serve as the means by which the Administration effectuates Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) drug pricing deals it made with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in November.

On December 29, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from implementing the 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program until further legal proceedings take place. The court ruled that the government had likely not sufficiently developed the administrative record to clear the Administrative Procedure Act’s requirements. The government appealed the court’s injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.



While the government moved both the district court and the First Circuit to stay the injunction pending appeal, both courts declined to do so. Accordingly, the 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program remains enjoined.

On December 29, 2025, CMS announced that all 50 states will be receiving funding from the Rural Health Transformation Program (RHTP) established by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Awards for FY 2026 averaged $200 million per state, with a range of $147 million to $281 million. CMS also announced that it was establishing the Office of Rural Health Transformation (ORHT) within CMCS to oversee and implement RHTP. ORHT will also provide technical assistance and coordinate federal and state partnerships in implementing RHTP.

On January 5, 2026, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court decision to prevent the NIH from implementing a policy capping indirect cost rates at 15 percent of an award’s value. The court ruled that the policy contradicted a congressional mandate in an appropriations law that prevented the Administration from significantly deviating from negotiated rates.

On January 5, 2026, CDC announced that it would be adopting recommendations to more closely align the U.S. childhood immunization schedule with other “peer, developed countries.” This includes adopting three distinct categories for immunization recommendations, all of which will still require insurance plans to cover their administration without cost-sharing: (1) Immunizations Recommended for All Children; (2) Immunizations Recommended for Certain High-Risk Groups or Populations; and (3) Immunizations Based on Shared Clinical Decision-Making.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) have extended the temporary telemedicine flexibilities for prescribing controlled substances through December 31, 2026. This rule permits all DEA-registered prescribers to remotely prescribe Schedules II-V controlled substances without an in-person medical evaluation.



DEA and SAMHSA previously finalized new rules allowing for the prescription of Schedules III-V controlled substances approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) via telemedicine, including an audio-only telemedicine encounter, and for the prescription of Schedules II-V controlled substances to VA patients if another VA practitioner has already conducted an in-person medical evaluation.



This rule is separate from the Medicare telehealth flexibilities, which are still set to expire at the end of this month.



The full notice extending the flexibilities can be found here.

NIH has reached a settlement in its ongoing litigation with the American Public Health Association (APHA) to reconsider grant applications that were denied for reasons related to the Administration’s directive to not fund research connected to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or “gender ideology.” Under this settlement, the NIH must have reviewed and made decisions for non-competing renewals by December 29, 2025. New award applications that have been reviewed by a study section and an advisory council must receive decisions by January 12, 2026. Applications reviewed by study sections alone must receive decisions by April 14, 2026, and those not yet reviewed by a study section must receive decisions by July 31, 2026. Notably, NIH is not obligated by the settlement to fund any particular application nor is NIH’s discretion over funding decisions affected.

Despite this progress, the future of the EPTCs remains in doubt. The Senate already voted down a three-year extension in December, and the 2026 coverage year has begun without the EPTCs in place. However, there are ongoing efforts in the Senate to negotiate a proposal that may include a two-year, retroactive extension of the EPTCs along with minimum premium payment requirements and a cap on income eligibility. The proposal may also include cost-sharing reductions for ACA Silver plans and expanded access to health savings accounts (HSAs). A draft of this proposal has yet to be released publicly but is the likelier of the two bills to potentially become law.
