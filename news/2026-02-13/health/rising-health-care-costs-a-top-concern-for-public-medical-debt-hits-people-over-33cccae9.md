## Summary
Public concern over rising health care costs is high, with medical debt disproportionately affecting people over 50, according to recent analysis.

## Full Article
Recent KFF polling shows that concern about health care costs is high and rising for the public, with 66% saying they are worried about paying for insurance and care.

Health Care Costs Are Biggest Financial Worry

For those polled by KFF, affording health care was the highest financial worry, even above utilities, food, and housing. The concerns cut across political parties, 71% of Democrats, 68% of Independents, and 57% of Republicans are worried or very worried about affording health care.

For those polled by KFF, affording health care was the highest financial worry, even above utilities, food, and housing.

These findings echo results from other recent polling that showed most adults were stressed about health care costs, and 83% were somewhat or very concerned that those costs would continue to climb.

Medical Debt High for Those 50–64

Current realities suggest these fears are not unfounded. Medical debt is high, especially for people 50–64 who are not yet eligible for Medicare. A new AARP report finds this population has the highest prevalence of medical debt of any age group.

It also shows that medical debt disproportionately affects non-Hispanic Black individuals and people in rural areas.

The report explains that medical debt for the 50–64 population has been kept somewhat in check by the availability of affordable health coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As a result, the non-renewal of vital ACA credits may trigger a spiral of worsening debt.

Expired ACA Credits Add to Rising Costs

Congress had the opportunity to extend these tax credits before they expired in 2025. Allowing them to lapse means millions of people are facing major hikes in their Marketplace insurance premiums and may lose coverage, affecting individuals, families, and whole communities.

Spiking Marketplace insurance premiums are especially likely to affect people 50–64.

These spiking premiums are especially likely to affect people 50–64. Over half of all enrollees who have been cut off from subsidies are between the ages of 50 and 64. And these enrollees are already at a cost disadvantage: under the ACA, insurers can charge people in their 50s and 60s higher premiums than they charge younger adults who purchase the same plan in the same area.

As this cohort faces unaffordable premiums, many may become uninsured and unable to seek health care. This, in turn, will increase Medicare costs as people age into coverage with more un- or under-treated health conditions.

Looming Affordability Challenges

The 2025 budget reconciliation bill, HR 1, is likely only to worsen affordability concerns and experiences. It slashed health care programs, with $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid alone. Cuts of this magnitude will impact access to care and support for older adults and people with disabilities.

Many of the most aggressive cuts are not yet in place, but states have already begun cutting Medicaid in anticipation of shrunken federal reimbursements and increased administrative burdens.

We Must Bring Down Health Care Costs and Expand Access to Care

At Medicare Rights, we share the public’s concern about high and rising health care costs and see even greater threats looming as HR 1 goes more fully into effect. We will continue to urge lawmakers to lower costs, renew the expired ACA credits, reverse course on HR 1, and instead focus on improving high-quality coverage and care.
