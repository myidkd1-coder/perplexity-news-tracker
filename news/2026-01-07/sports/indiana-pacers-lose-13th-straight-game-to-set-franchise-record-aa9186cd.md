After Harrisburg missed two free throws, Mitchell’s Owen Raml finished a three-point play to make it 56-51 with 52 seconds remaining to cap a 7-0 Kernels run in just nine seconds.

NFL

— John Harbaugh has been fired after 18 seasons as the Baltimore Ravens’ head coach. Owner Steve Bisciotti said Tuesday that Harbaugh was relieved of his duties after the Ravens were one of the league’s most disappointing teams this season. They went 8-9 and missed the playoffs after entering Week 1 as one of the Super Bowl favorites. Baltimore’s season ended Sunday night when kicker Tyler Loop missed a last-second field goal attempt, allowing Pittsburgh to hold on for a 26-24 victory in the game that decided the AFC North title.

— The Dallas Cowboys have fired first-year defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after they allowed the most points and intercepted the fewest passes in franchise history. It’s the second consecutive season in which Eberflus has been fired. He was let go midseason in 2024, his third year as head coach of the Chicago Bears.

— The Detroit Lions have fired offensive coordinator John Morton. The move Tuesday was expected after the Lions missed the playoffs and coach Dan Campbell took over Morton’s play-calling duties midway through the season. Campbell is now looking for his third offensive coordinator in three seasons. Former OC Ben Johnson left the Lions a little more than a year ago to lead the Chicago Bears and helped them win the NFC North.

— Kliff Kingsbury and Joe Whitt Jr. are both gone from head coach Dan Quinn’s staff with the Washington Commanders after a 5-12 season. Kingsbury, the offensive coordinator, and Whitt, who had been in charge of the defense until being stripped of play-calling duties during the season, arrived in Washington with Quinn before the 2024 season. Quinn and Kingsbury mutually agreed to part ways, while Whitt was fired.

NASCAR

— NASCAR Commissioner Steve Phelps has announced his resignation after over 20 years with the organization. His departure follows a federal trial where inflammatory texts he sent during revenue-sharing negotiations were revealed. Phelps will leave at the end of the month, ahead of the season’s start. His texts, including a derogatory comment about Hall of Fame team owner Richard Childress, led to backlash from supporters. NASCAR has not announced plans to replace him immediately.
