Welcome to the January digital issue, dear reader! I’m beyond thrilled to introduce our cover star—a woman whose face will be familiar to many when the hotly anticipated new season of Bridgerton arrives on our screens next week. Aussie actor Yerin Ha is the Netflix juggernaut’s newest leading lady, and much like her on-screen character, Sophie Baek, she’s poised for her Cinderella moment—while keeping her head firmly out of the clouds. “I’m a little bit of an I’ll-believe-it-when-I-see-it kind of girl,” Ha tells InStyle Fashion Features Director Madeline Hirsch, reflecting on the Bridgerton “poof” effect that’s almost certain to transform her life. In our profile, Ha opens up about her fairytale journey to landing the role, meeting her on-screen Prince Charming (and their instant real-life chemistry), and why it was so important to her to bring her own lived experience to this new character.

There’s more magic to be had courtesy of Lisa Rinna, who shares real, delicious behind-the-scenes drama from her Real Housewives experience in an exclusive excerpt from her upcoming memoir, You Better Believe I’m Gonna Talk About It. Beauty Editor Kara Jillian Brown also provides a roadmap to the season’s hottest nail trend: patterned manicures. Classic patterns, she says, are hands-down the easiest way to satisfy both minimalists and maximalists—and whether it’s plaid or polka dots, she’ll convince you that the nail look of the moment is quite literally at your fingertips. Elsewhere in this issue, Assistant Editor Christina Perrier explores her relationship with her long hair—a longtime security blanket she’s finally ready to snip. Plus, our fashion team dives into the wild world of phone accessories, breaking down how a whimsical little phone case became a Gen Z status symbol.

Special thanks to Pandora for powering this issue. I hope you enjoy!

Cashmere Charm

As winter wears on (how are we just one month in?), the urge to cuddle up in something cozy only grows stronger. And while sweatshirts and flannel abound, when it comes to being both warm and chic, we consider cashmere to be the G.O.A.T—and not just because it comes from the animal.

Cashmere pieces are rich-looking (and rich-feeling), easy to style, and will keep you oh-so toasty. Originally introduced in Europe from Central Asia in the 19th century, cashmere was reserved for royals and the upper class. Queen Victoria and Empress Joséphine of France were early proponents of the natural material; the luxurious, silky-soft textile has since become a must-have wardrobe staple for fashion lovers in cool climes worldwide. Take supermodel Gigi Hadid, who’s such a champion of cashmere that she started her own line of high-quality, heirloom-style knitwear.

The best part about cashmere is that not only is it possible to find an endless array of pieces to match your style, but you can also find ones that match your budget, from high-end brands like Max Mara to more affordable ones like Banana Republic and Quince.
