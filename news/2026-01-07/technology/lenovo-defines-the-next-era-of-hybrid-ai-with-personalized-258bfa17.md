“For each of us, AI will boost our creativity, sharpen our intuition, and inspire our imagination, because it now draws from our unique language, habits, experiences, and memories. This is a fundamental shift towards augmenting, elevating, and maximizing human potential,” said Lenovo Chairman and CEO Yuanqing Yang. “For a business, the transformation is even more profound: AI is going beyond process management and workflow optimization. It now empowers organizations to use proprietary data generated from their own operations and apply their own decision logic to become a self-learning, self-reinventing entity.”

This rapid adaptation and customization herald an unprecedented degree of seamless operation, with AI agents acting and interacting with greater autonomy and expertise—on device, on private servers, or in the cloud.

“This is what we call intelligent model orchestration and is the foundation of any AI Super Agent,” said Lenovo CTO Tolga Kurtoglu. “It enables an AI agent to access a pool of specialized models, identify the best one for the user’s need of the moment, and optimize performance—maximizing security, minimizing latency, and reducing compute cost.”

Personal AI across devices with Lenovo and Motorola Qira

Lenovo and Motorola Qira is a personal AI super agent that works seamlessly across Lenovo and Motorola devices—including PCs, smartphones, tablets, and wearables—to deliver context-aware assistance. This unified AI, called a Personal Ambient Intelligence System, appears as Lenovo Qira on Lenovo products and Motorola Qira on Motorola products and embodies Lenovo’s commitment to offering one personal AI across multiple devices.

With the user’s permission, Lenovo Qira is designed to understand users and take actions across supported devices, apps, and services, operating across Lenovo and Motorola products. Using multimodal inputs and a personal knowledge base, Lenovo Qira learns from the information users choose to share and applies that understanding wherever they are to offer help that feels immediate and personal.
