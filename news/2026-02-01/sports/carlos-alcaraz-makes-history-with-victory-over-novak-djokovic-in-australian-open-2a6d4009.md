## Full Article
World No 1 Carlos Alcaraz completed a career Grand Slam - winning all four major singles title - at the age of 22 with a four-set victory over Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Alcaraz was four years old when Djokovic first reached the final here in 2008, and in the clash of the generations it was the Spaniard who came out on top with a 2-6 6-2 6-3 7-5 victory on Rod Laver Arena.

With two trophies at each at the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam with his maiden title in Melbourne, eclipsing Don Budge - who wrapped up his at the 1938 French Open two days before his 23rd birthday - and denying the Serb a record 25th major title.

It is the first time in 11 finals at Melbourne Park that Djokovic has not come out the victor, but, having beaten one of the two new kings of men's tennis, Jannik Sinner, in an extraordinary semi-final, the other one was a step too far.

The man from Murcia is five years younger than Djokovic was when he reached seven Grand Slam titles, with only Bjorn Borg anywhere close to the same figures.

"Nobody knows how hard I've worked to get this trophy," said Alcaraz after lifting the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup.

"I chased this moment so much. I appreciate it was a rollercoaster emotionally, and my team and I went through stuff but did the right work. This trophy is yours as well.

"I can't wait to come back here next year."

How Alcaraz came from a set down to defeat Djokovic...

Djokovic had played at a sensational level for four hours against Sinner and he started the same here, timing the ball beautifully and completely outplaying Alcaraz in the opening set.

But the momentum switched on the luckiest of net cords for Alcaraz at 15-15 in the third game of the second set, the ball dropping dead on Djokovic's side of the court and prompting his opponent to raise both hands in apology.

Two points later, Alcaraz had a break of serve and a foothold in the match, with Djokovic's statistics very much heading in the wrong direction.

He headed off court for a bathroom break while the roof, which had only been a quarter open on a cool Melbourne evening, closed still further, prompting pointed questioning of officials from Alcaraz and a swift change of tack.

One of the big questions surrounding the match was how Djokovic would recover physically after his exertions of Friday.

Although Alcaraz had an even longer encounter with Alexander Zverev, and battled through cramp, he is 16 years younger.

It was scarcely possible to believe Djokovic's age as he somehow retrieved a deep backhand then sprinted forward to send a short angled flick from Alcaraz around the net post, the Serbian standing with his hands on his hips after watching his opponent scramble it back, bringing the crowd to their feet.

But Alcaraz, who has now won three Grand Slam finals against the Serb after back-to-back triumphs at Wimbledon, was beginning to find all the answers, and Djokovic's resistance was broken again in the fifth game.

The watching Rafael Nadal, who must have been having flashbacks to his battles with Djokovic here, nodded his approval.

Nadal never got the better of his great rival on Rod Laver Arena - very few have - but Alcaraz was showing his full box of tricks, and Djokovic was powerless to resist.

Djokovic took tablets during a visit from the trainer before the fourth set, and hung on grimly through an epic first service game, saving six break points and soaking up the energy from his fans.

Would Nadal perhaps like to play in his place, Djokovic inquired of the Spaniard, who chuckled in response and stayed firmly in his seat.

Djokovic grimaced after just missing a forehand that would have given him a 5-4 lead, Alcaraz roaring in delight after surviving the game.

It was to prove Djokovic's final chance, with Alcaraz collapsing to the court after a final forehand from his opponent flew long.

"You guys gave me something, ‍particularly the last couple of matches, with the love and support," said Djokovic. "I try to give you back with good tennis over the years.

"This I think was my 21st year coming to Australia. I always believe in myself which is something truly needed when you play against incredible players like I have ​the last few days.

"I didn't think I would be standing at the closing ceremony of a Grand Slam again. God knows what happens tomorrow, let alone six or 12 months. It has been a great ‍ride. I love you guys."
