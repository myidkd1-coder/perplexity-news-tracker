## Full Article
It’s Tuesday, January 27, 2026, and we’re back with today’s top startup and tech funding news. Today’s capital flows underscore continued investor appetite for verticalized AI agents, industrial automation, cybersecurity, and orbital infrastructure. As generative AI settles into enterprise stacks, capital is shifting toward specialized platforms that embed intelligence into specific workflows and supply chains.

AI-native process automation dominated the early-stage landscape. Pace raised $10 million to eliminate back-office drudgery in insurance ops, while Risotto secured $10 million to offload IT tickets with an autonomous help desk agent. Flora landed $42 million to power creative workflows with node-based AI design tools, and Concourse closed a $12 million Series A to embed agentic finance copilots in corporate FP&A teams.

Defense, robotics, and space infrastructure commanded later-stage attention. Vention raised $110 million to scale its industrial automation platform, while Northwood Space brought in $100 million to expand its AI-driven ground station network. SpotDraft’s $8 million Series B extension brought on Qualcomm to accelerate its on-device legal AI stack. Cybersecurity, biotech, and design tech also saw traction, with Memcyco, TRex Bio, and Dentio rounding out today’s cohort.

Investor Activity

Today’s rounds drew strong participation from frontier-tech investors, institutional venture arms, and AI-focused backers. With a mix of early breakout bets and expansion-stage capital, investors are concentrating dollars behind teams operationalizing agentic AI and hardening core physical infrastructure. Here’s the full breakdown of January 27’s most significant startup and tech fundings.

Pace Raises $10M in Series A Funding for AI-Powered Insurance Workflows

Pace, a London-based AI startup, announced that it has raised $10 million in Series A funding led by Sequoia Capital. The company offers an enterprise platform that uses AI agents to automate insurance operations and business process outsourcing tasks. By feeding on massive volumes of policy and claims documents, Pace’s software aims to streamline manual workflows that are traditionally handled offshore or with many personnel.

This new funding will help Pace scale its team and product as it targets a sector where over $70 billion is spent annually on outsourced back-office functions. Sequoia partner Bryan Schreier, who led the round, noted that AI is poised to disrupt this market by handling its complex, document-heavy tasks.

Dentio’s platform helps dentists automate clinical documentation, insurance billing, and other administrative tasks that consume clinicians’ time. Its co-founders, all 23-year-olds who met in high school, began by tackling the heavy paperwork burden seen in dental practices.

With the new funding, Dentio plans to refine its AI-powered documentation tools and prepare for expansion into other Nordic markets later this year. The company says that 80% of young dentists cite administrative work as a major stressor, underscoring the demand for such automation.

Northwood Space Raises $100M in Series B Funding to Expand Satellite Ground Network

Northwood Space, a U.S. space tech startup, has secured $100 million in Series B funding along with a separate ~$50 million contract from the U.S. Space Force. The Series B was co-led by Washington Harbour Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, with Alpine Space Ventures, Founders Fund, StepStone, Balerion Space Ventures, Fulcrum, Pax, 137 Ventures, and others participating.

Northwood builds vertically integrated ground station networks (satellite control infrastructure) that can be rapidly deployed. Its Portal multi-beam antenna and software stack enable operators to establish satellite links in hours rather than months. The latest funding will go toward building more ground infrastructure worldwide and supporting emerging mission requirements. The concurrent Space Force award validates Northwood’s approach: the company delivered communication links for Department of Defense satellites within three months of the contract.

SpotDraft Raises $8M in Series B Extension for On-Device Contract AI

SpotDraft, a Bangalore-based legaltech startup, announced it has raised $8 million in a Series B extension led by Qualcomm Ventures. The company provides AI-driven contract review software that runs on-device (e.g., on a user’s laptop) to keep sensitive legal documents private. By processing contracts locally, SpotDraft addresses the growing demand for privacy-first enterprise AI in regulated fields. Its technology can analyze, compare, and redline contract terms without sending files to the cloud.

The extension follows SpotDraft’s $54 million Series B in early 2025 and roughly doubles the company’s valuation to about $380 million. The new capital will help scale its team and product as it commercializes its offline VerifAI workflow demonstrated on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon platform.

TRex Bio’s approach activates regulatory T cells to suppress inflammation, a targeted strategy in a competitive market.

The financing round included participation from major biotech investors, including Janus Henderson, Alexandria Venture Investments, and Eli Lilly. This brings TRex Bio’s total funding to about $134 million, following an $84 million initial Series B in 2024. The company said the new funds will help move multiple early-stage programs through trials.

Flora Raises $42M in Series A Funding for AI-Driven Node-Based Design Platform

Flora, a San Francisco design-tech startup, announced it has closed a $42 million Series A round led by Redpoint Ventures. The company is building a generative design platform where creators use image, text, or video prompts to generate and iterate on visual assets via a node-based workflow.

By mapping creative ideas as a graph of “nodes,” Flora enables designers to branch into multiple design variations and compare outcomes in one interface. This approach addresses a gap left by traditional tools (like Figma or Canva) as AI art generation becomes mainstream. The funds will help Flora expand its product, as designers at companies like Alibaba, Brex, and Lionsgate have already tested its generative interface.

Risotto Raises $10M in Seed Funding for AI-Powered Help Desk Ticketing

Risotto, a New York startup automating IT help desks, announced a $10 million seed round led by Bonfire Ventures. The company’s AI platform connects to ticketing systems (such as Jira) and uses a trained AI model and curated workflows to autonomously resolve support tickets.

By integrating with companies’ internal support tools, Risotto reduces the time IT teams spend on repetitive tasks. Early customers report significant ticket reduction (for example, automating 60% of one company’s issues). The seed funding, which also included investors 645 Ventures, Y Combinator, Ritual Capital, and SurgePoint Capital, will help Risotto scale its team and refine its help-desk AI agent.
