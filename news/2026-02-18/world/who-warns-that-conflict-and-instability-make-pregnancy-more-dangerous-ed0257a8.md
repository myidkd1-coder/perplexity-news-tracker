WHO warns that conflict and instability make pregnancy more dangerous

Nearly two-thirds of all maternal deaths worldwide occur in countries affected by conflict or fragility, according to a new report from the World Health Organization, WHO.

The analysis finds that women living in conflict-affected countries face about five times the risk of dying from maternal causes compared to those in stable settings.

In 2023, an estimated 160,000 women died from preventable maternal causes in fragile and conflict-affected settings – accounting for six in ten maternal deaths globally, even though those countries represent only about one-tenth of all births worldwide.

The brief highlights how crises disrupt lifesaving care – from shortages of trained staff to attacks on health facilities – while intersecting inequalities, including gender, ethnicity and migration status, further compound risks.

Case studies from Colombia, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Ukraine show how local innovation can help save lives – from mobile midwife teams and renovated clinics to affordable emergency obstetric care and reorganized hospital pathways.

WHO and partners say linking maternal mortality data with fragility indicators offers a new tool to better target health investments and strengthen resilience where it is needed most.

Ukraine: UN agencies warn of worsening civilian suffering amid attacks and freezing winter

As Ukraine approaches four years since Russia’s full-scale invasion, UN humanitarians warn that civilian suffering continues to deepen, with relentless attacks, power outages and sub-zero temperatures putting millions at risk.

Speaking from a basement in Kherson, UNICEF Representative Munir Mammadzade described a city “under constant fire,” where children live, learn and play underground for safety.

“So today children learn playing and sleep in basements just to stay safe. And we, as UNICEF, support many facilities like the one I'm right now in. I have been speaking to families and staff here, including psychologists and case managers. There are actually kids even in the neighbouring room playing and engaging with psychologists, which is something precious to witness in places like Kherson, because you hardly see people outside”

Only about 5,000 of the 60,000 children who once lived in Kherson remain, many sheltering in basements converted into child protection hubs.

He said the constant fear of attacks and prolonged isolation are taking a severe toll on children’s mental and physical health across the country – including in areas far from the front lines, such as western Ukraine and the capital, Kyiv.

The International Organization for Migration, IOM, said daily life is also shaped by repeated power cuts caused by strikes on energy infrastructure.

With temperatures plunging to minus 20 degrees Celsius or minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit, communities are struggling to stay warm and maintain access to basic services.

Ukraine remains Europe’s largest displacement crisis, with 9.6 million people forced from their homes – including 3.7 million internally displaced. Many families have been uprooted multiple times, and more than a third of returnees risk being displaced again.

UN Secretary-General’s message for Lunar New Year

The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres has extended his best wishes to all those celebrating the Lunar New Year, welcoming the Year of the Horse as a time for renewed hope, strength, and collective purpose.

Marking the start of the new lunar cycle, he described the horse as a symbol of energy, determination and progress – qualities the world urgently needs amid conflict, inequality and the escalating climate crisis.

He said the Lunar New Year is a season of renewal and shared humanity, reminding people everywhere of the power of cooperation to build a safer, fairer and more sustainable future for all.

The Secretary-General encouraged the global community to draw inspiration from the spirit of the horse to advance peace, dignity and sustainable development, and expressed hope that the coming year brings health, happiness and prosperity to people across the world.
