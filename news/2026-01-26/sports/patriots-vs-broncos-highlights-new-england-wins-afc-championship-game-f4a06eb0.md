The first ticket to Santa Clara is booked!

The No. 2 New England Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl after outlasting the top-seeded Denver Broncos in a snowy, instant-classic AFC Championship Game at Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday.

The Broncos were without quarterback Bo Nix, who broke his ankle late in their win over the Buffalo Bills last week. Drake Maye and the Patriots, meanwhile, continued their hot streak after convincing wins over the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans to reach this round.

Here are the highlights, with coverage from FOX Sports' Ralph Vacchiano.
