Asserting India's pivotal position in global technology governance, Duncan Cass-Beggs, Executive Director of the Global AI Risks Initiative at the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), said that India has a "crucial role" in bringing the world together to address the emerging challenges of artificial intelligence (AI).





Speaking to ANI on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 that began on Monday, Cass-Beggs remarked, "I'm delighted to be here in India. I think that India would have a crucial role, just as we're seeing this week, in pulling people together from all corners of the world. And I believe India would have a lot to offer too in the international governance and international cooperation discussion around what might be needed for AI."





He emphasised that no single nation can address these global-scale challenges alone, underscoring the urgent need for international coordination.





Cass-Beggs further noted that the world must prepare for a full spectrum of possibilities, ranging from an "AI winter" to systems that recursively self-improve.

He cautioned that governments remain least prepared for scenarios involving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).





"These would be systems that vastly surpass humans across all cognitive capabilities. And if that happens, these scenarios could really be a game-changer for all aspects of humanity -- in terms of prosperity, but also in terms of security and even the continued role of humans as the leading controllers of our destiny," he said
