## Full Article
Val Kilmer's one silly gift to Tom Cruise showed how the actors played up their Top Gun rivalry even off the cameras.

Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer took some of the Maverick vs Iceman rivalry behind the scenes as well. Kilmer jokingly revealed multiple times in interviews that their on-screen tension in Top Gun almost felt personal at times. One old interview story from Kilmer would put into perspective their off-screen dynamics at the time.

Kilmer, known for his sharp wit, gifted Cruise with a baby book on how to fly a plane during the production of the movie. He shared with Entertainment Tonight that he would torture Cruise like his character would do to Cruise’s character in the movie. Kilmer shared (via @RealEmirHan / X):

I’d get him kids’ books on how to fly, like big large print in the Smithsonian. ‘How To Fly A Plane.’ Like things to torture him like the character would do —we had a great time.

Not only did Cruise and Kilmer grow their relationship after Top Gun, but it also appeared that their characters turned out to be great friends as well. Kilmer returned to 2022’s Top Gun: Maverick as Iceman. Cruise’s Maverick turned to Iceman for advice about Rooster in the movie.

In Val Kilmer’s 2021 Prime Video documentary, Val, he shared further details of what happened with Tom Cruise off-screen. While they never had any personal issues, Kilmer explained that he did certain things to keep up the Maverick-Iceman tension off-screen.

Kilmer revealed that he went on to create a backstory for his character, explaining why he would be so arrogant in the movie. Kilmer explained:

I manifested a backstory for him, where he had a father who ignored him, and as a result, I was driven by a need to be perfect in every way. This obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant.

Kilmer shared that the movie had “two distinct camps” between actors after he played up the tension between him and Cruise. However, he clarified that it was all fun and never adversarial between them. He shared:

It was fun to play up the conflict between our characters, but in reality, I’ve always thought of Tom as a friend, and we’ve always supported each other.

Kilmer also shared in another Reddit AMA that Cruise was mostly unavailable to join him and the other actors for some fun time due to his packed filming schedule. He shared, “I actually felt a little sorry for him… But Tom was always in some scene and never go to play with us…” However, they kept their bond tight even after the movie.

Val Kilmer passed away on April 1, 2025, due to pneumonia. When Tom Cruise later appeared at CinemaCon this year, he shared an emotional tribute to Kilmer and talked about their on-screen rivalry. Cruise shared that he admired all of Kilmer’s work and added that he was honored to work with him in Top Gun and its sequel. He shared (via Variety):

I’d like to honor a dear friend of mine, Val Kilmer. I can’t tell you how much I admire his work, how grateful and honored I was when he joined Top Gun and came back later for Top Gun: Maverick. I think it would be really nice if we could have a moment together because he loved movies and he gave a lot to all of us. Just kind of think about all the wonderful times that we had with him.

Cruise concluded his emotional farewell to the actor by saying, “I wish you well on the next journey.” In the 2022 movie, Kilmer’s character Iceman is shown to be battling terminal cancer. The character passes away in the movie.
