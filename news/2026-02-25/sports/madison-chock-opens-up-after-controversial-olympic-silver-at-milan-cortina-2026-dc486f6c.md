Mikaela Shiffrin Talks Competing at 2030 Olympics & "Lazy" Gold Medal Redemption Narrative

Mikaela Shiffrin sat down with Sports Illustrated's Greg Cally at the Milan Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics to reflect on her latest gold medal and address the growing conversation about what comes next. In a candid conversation, Mikaela Shiffrin responds to questions about whether she will compete at the 2030 Winter Olympics and pushes back on what she describes as an oversimplified “redemption” narrative surrounding her recent gold medal win. Shiffrin explains why the storyline of revenge or ending a medal drought fails to capture the emotional and personal growth she experienced following Beijing. She opens up about managing the long wait between runs, the mental reset she experienced before her second run, and the powerful moment of gratitude she felt thinking about her family and late father before taking the course. Mikaela Shiffrin also shares her parents’ philosophy about triumph, why the joy is in the performance rather than the medal itself, what she actually does with her Olympic medals, and how she is thinking about the future. This is Mikaela Shiffrin on growth, perspective, legacy, and whether another Olympic cycle is on the horizon.
