The week closed with the UK equities edging higher. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.5% to finish at 10,224 points, while the FTSE 250 was little changed at 23,253.

The sharp reversal split across commodity markets on Friday, with gold, silver and copper also retreating. Despite the drop, gold remains up around 18% over the past week and 82% year on year; silver is still up 46% on the week and an extraordinary 232% over the past year. Copper also lost ground, sliding 3% to around $6 a pound after spiking to $6.57 earlier in the week. The red metal remains up 5.7% for the month and 41% year on year.
