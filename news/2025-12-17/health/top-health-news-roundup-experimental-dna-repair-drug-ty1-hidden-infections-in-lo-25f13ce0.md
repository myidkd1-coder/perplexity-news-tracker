## Summary
ScienceDaily's health news roundup highlights a new experimental drug (TY1) that repairs DNA, emerging evidence that hidden infections may drive long COVID symptoms, and an analysis suggesting GLP-1 drugs (e.g., Ozempic) may lower epilepsy risk among people with type 2 diabetes, among other recent findings.
