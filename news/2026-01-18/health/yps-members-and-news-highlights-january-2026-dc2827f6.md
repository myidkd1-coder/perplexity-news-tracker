Advocacy efforts

Welcome to a new year! I hope everyone was able to enjoy the holiday season.

As we dive into 2026, the focus of the first several months will be on advocacy efforts. The AMA State Advocacy Summit took place early January and the AMA National Advocacy Conference is in February. AMA advocacy efforts continue to focus on Medicaid funding, scope creep, physician shortage and AI.

ACA enhanced subsidies extension

In positive news, the U.S. House of Representatives has just passed a three-year extension for the Affordable Care Act enhanced subsidies. The outlook for this passing through the Senate is not as optimistic, as the Senate voted last month against a three-year extension. We will continue to fight to see that our patients are given opportunities to access the care that they need.

Handbook Review Committee

In YPS news, we have opened applications for our newest standing committee, the Handbook Review Committee. We will continue to accept applications through Jan. 22.

As the AMA House of Delegates moves to be more efficient and utilize the online reference committee, the YPS will need to grow and adapt in order to continue to engage. We hope this new standing committee will help us to achieve those goals and provide further opportunities for engagement.

I am looking forward to seeing many of you very soon! If you have comments, questions or need additional information, please email us at [email protected] or post in the GroupMe.
