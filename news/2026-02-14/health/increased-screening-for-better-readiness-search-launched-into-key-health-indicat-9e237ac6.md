Preventive health and Person-Partnered Care (PPC)

Beginning in Fall 2023 through 2024, 12 Canadian Forces Health Services Centre (CF H Svcs C) Wainwright undertook a quality improvement project to strengthen preventive health services. Preventive health services support health and enable early detection of medical conditions. These services include routine checkups, screenings (i.e. cancer, blood pressure), immunizations, and lifestyle counseling.

The project, initiated by Captain (Navy) Nicholas Gauthier and Major (Maj) Dave Fedoruk, and implemented by Mindy McClennon and Maj Laura Watts, focused on two key areas: cervical cancer screening and routine immunizations.

This project reflects the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF) Person-Partnered Care (PPC) framework, which highlights a patient’s involvement in their own care.

The patient, care team, and Chain of Command each have a role to play:

You can take ownership of your health by checking when you are due for screenings and vaccines.

is here to listen, educate, and help you make informed decisions. Your Chain of Command supports your ability to attend appointments and get the care you need.

Cervical cancer screening review

A gap was identified in the preventive health program for CAF members in Wainwright; there was no system to remind people when they were due for Pap tests. Without reminders and with routine healthcare having taken a back seat during COVID-19, the team focused on ensuring cervical cancer screening (Pap tests) were up to date for eligible CAF members.

The team reviewed patient records and found that 31% of eligible members were due, overdue, or had never had a Pap test. Members were contacted and booked to complete the testing, creating opportunities to have conversations about birth control, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) prevention, and sexual health in general. If you are unsure if you are due for a Pap test, contact your local CF H Svcs C or contact your healthcare provider.

Immunization review

The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to routine immunization programs around the world, including for CAF members. During this time, deployments continued to areas of the world with higher risk of measles, polio, and other preventable diseases, while the risk of these diseases increased in Canada.

Our review revealed that 33% of screened CAF members in Wainwright were not up to date on routine immunizations, mostly due to missed doses of polio or tetanus, or because new recruits were still completing their baseline vaccinations. Staying current with vaccinations improves both personal health and operational readiness.

If you are unsure about your immunization status, book an appointment with your clinic’s Community Health Nurse or contact your healthcare provider.

Final thoughts

This project highlights how teamwork between patients, providers, and leadership leads to better outcomes. Tracking and addressing the medical needs of our patients is a top priority, especially across postings and provinces, but isn't always perfect. Your involvement as a patient is essential.
