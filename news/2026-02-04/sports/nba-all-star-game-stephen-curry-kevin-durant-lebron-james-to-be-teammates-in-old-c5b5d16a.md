Steph Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant will be teammates as part of a new format for the NBA All-Star Game, live this month on Sky Sports.

The 'Team USA vs Team World' concept has been discussed for some time but will be implemented in the 2026 edition of the mid-season showpiece, taking place on February 15 at the Inuit Dome - the Los Angeles Clippers' home venue.

James, named among the reserves from the Western Conference after initially missing out on a record-extending 22nd NBA All-Star appearance, is among the 25 names involved that will be split into three squads.

The two United States teams are assigned based on age, with younger players placed on 'USA Stars' and the older group place on 'USA Stripes', with 'Team World' then composed on the international players selected.

Detroit Pistons head coach J.B. Bickerstaff will lead the USA Stars and San Antonio Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson takes charge of the USA Stripes, with Toronto Raptors head coach Darko Rajaković of Serbia coaching Team World.

The 75th NBA All-Star Game will feature a round-robin mini-tournament with four 12-minute games, with each team playing each other once and then the top two sides playing the Championship match.

All three teams had at least eight players, the minimum required under the new format. Giannis Antetokounmpo is not expected to play for the World team because of injury, which is why that squad has nine players.
