## Full Article
Happy New Year, folks!

Here’s some heartening news to begin 2026 on a hopeful note. Last year, The Indian Express highlighted how officer cadets who had been disabled during military training were discharged and left to fend for themselves, paying for medical treatment with no support. In August, the Supreme Court stepped in, taking suo motu cognisance of their plight. Soon after, the Ministry of Defence issued an order extending Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) benefits to these cadets. This entitles to free treatment at military hospitals and empanelled private facilities.

We spoke to some of these officer cadets, who described the move as a “huge relief.” The Supreme Court-appointed amicus curiae has gone a step further, recommending disability pensions and rehabilitation support for them as well. Read our report.

On that note, let’s get to the rest of today’s edition👇

🚨 Big Story

The government is seeking public feedback on the draft rules for the four Labour Codes that were notified in November. These include the Code on Wages, the Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code, and the Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions (OSH) Code. The government has given 30-45 days for comments.

The final rules are likely to be notified in March, and the labour codes will come into effect on April 1, at the start of the next financial year.

What’s changing? According to the draft rules, employees will work not more than 48 hours a week. It introduces a night shift for women (7 pm to 6 am) with pick-up and drop-off facilities, and a mandatory safe, well-lit work environment. Read more.

In an ongoing series, where our newsroom editors reflect on the biggest trends in 2025, and analyse what 2026 has in store, today the focus is on the judiciary. Last year, the conduct of judges dominated the legal landscape amid a cash row involving Judge Yashwant Varma and the failed impeachment motion against Justice Shekhar Yadav. In the era of live-streaming, 2026 is likely to see continued public scrutiny of judges. The Supreme Court is also set hear some major matters, such as challenges to the Waqf Law and Special Intensive Revision. Apurva Vishwanath, National Legal Editor, explains.

📰 From the Front Page

Fuelling ambitions: India has long projected thorium as a viable alternative to uranium for nuclear power. The reason is straightforward: the country has relatively limited uranium reserves but abundant thorium deposits. Successfully harnessing thorium could significantly reduce India’s dependence on imported nuclear fuel. Now, a step in that direction may be taking shape. NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power utility, is set to partner with Chicago-based Clean Core Thorium Energy (CCTE) to develop thorium-based fuel for nuclear reactors.

Banned: It’s the season of coughs and colds. Be advised that the government has banned the manufacture, sale and distribution of nimesulide, a common pain and fever medication, in all oral “immediate release” formulations above the dosage of 100 mg, as it poses a health risk. Additionally, you soon require a prescription for cough syrups as the Ministry has released a draft notification removing them from the list of over-the-counter medicines.

It’s official: Shortly after the New Year’s Eve ball drops in Times Square at midnight (EST), Zohran Mamdani will be sworn in as the mayor of New York City. Mamdani captured most of the world’s imagination with his social media-first campaign, becoming NYC’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor. He will take the oath of office amid a small gathering of friends and family at an abandoned subway station, followed by a public inauguration at the steps of City Hall.

⏳ And Finally…

As gig workers called for a strike on New Year’s Eve, quick commerce platforms, Swiggy and Zomato, announced higher incentives for delivery workers during peak hours and year-end days. The move was presumably aimed at ensuring smooth operations. But why are gig workers striking? They are seeking a ban on 10-minute delivery models, among other issues. Read here.

That’s all for today! Here’s hoping you have a great year ahead.
