US Senate Hearing Turns Viral After Indian-Origin Doctor Refuses Yes Or No On Men Getting Pregnant

What began as a discussion on abortion pill safety turned into one of the most awkward moments on Capitol Hill. Senator Josh Hawley asked Indian-origin doctor Dr Nisha Verma a basic biological question — can men get pregnant? Despite being a medical professional, Verma declined to answer directly, saying the question was political and polarising. Hawley responded sharply, stating that women are a biological reality and that science must not bend to ideology. The clip has since gone viral, drawing massive reactions across social media. Supporters say the moment exposed ideological confusion in elite institutions. Critics argue it was an attempt to derail serious policy discussion. Either way, the exchange highlights how deeply culture wars have entered science, medicine and governance in the United States — and why even basic facts are now fiercely contested.
