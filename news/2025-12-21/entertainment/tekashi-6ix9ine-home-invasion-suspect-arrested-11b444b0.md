Looks like Santa delivered Lily Allen an early Christmas present -- a new boy toy she can't keep her hands off of!

Check out the lovey dovey pics from the singer's Christmas soiree in London Friday night ... she and rumored beau Jonah Freud were in their own little world as they locked lips for all to see.
