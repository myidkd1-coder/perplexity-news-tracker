Gambling regulators in Canada fined sportsbook FanDuel $350,000 on Thursday, accusing the company of failing to identify and report suspicious betting activity on international table tennis matches in 2024.

Between Oct. 23 and Nov. 30, 2024, FanDuel accepted 144 bets from three betting accounts in Ontario on Czech Table Tennis Star Series matches that "displayed multiple indicators associated with match-fixing," the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) alleged in a release announcing the fine.

The AGCO said FanDuel failed to notice several red flags, including abrupt movement in the odds on matches involving two specific athletes; a concentration of bets on those athletes to lose, and the bettors' "implausible and near-perfect" win-rate. The sportsbook industry had previously been alerted to integrity concerns surrounding the Czech Table Tennis Star Series, according to the AGCO.

The $350,000 fine is believed to be the largest levied by the AGCO since the legal betting market launched in Canada in 2021.

FanDuel said in a statement that it is disappointed at the fine and that it was the only operator to "proactively identify, investigate and report the activity" to the AGCO. The AGCO declined to answer questions about which sportsbooks, if any, reported the suspicious betting activity.

"As an operator that prides itself on the trust we have built with our stakeholders, we do not feel that this action accurately reflects the commitment and investment we have consistently demonstrated regarding protecting the industry, our customers, and the integrity of sport," a FanDuel spokesperson said in a statement. "We also are concerned it could discourage the industry from engaging in best efforts to identify, investigate, and report on irregular activity. "While we are disappointed with the decision made by the AGCO to issue this fine, we are unwavering in our commitment to working with them to identify areas of integrity concerns and protect sports from those who seek to undermine fair competition and the games we love."

FanDuel has 15 days to appeal the fine. The AGCO did not identify the table tennis players or the bettors allegedly involved. Dave Phillips, chief operating officer for AGCO, said the case had been referred to Ontario Provincial Police for further investigation.

"In an era of heightened scrutiny on sports integrity, igaming operators must be vigilant and proactive in detecting suspicious betting activity and taking appropriate steps to protect their patrons," Dr. Karin Schnarr, CEO and registrar for the AGCO, said in the release. "We will continue to hold all regulated operators accountable to these standards. Protecting fair play is essential to maintaining public trust."

Betting on international table tennis increased in popularity, including in the United States, during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a heavily-bet sport. Matches are broadcast throughout the day, with streams of the action available on some sports betting apps. More money is bet on table tennis than ice hockey on a month-to-month basis with Colorado sportsbooks.

Occasional integrity concerns regarding table tennis have surfaced over the years. The International Betting Integrity Association, a firm that monitors the global betting market, reported that table tennis accounted for the third-most suspicious activity alerts in Q3 2025, after soccer and tennis.

ESPN has reached out to the Czech Table Tennis Star Series for comment.
