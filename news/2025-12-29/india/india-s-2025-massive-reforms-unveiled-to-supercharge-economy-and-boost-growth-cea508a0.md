Year of Reforms: India's Economic Overhaul in 2025

2025 marked a pivotal year for India's economic landscape as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, rolled out a comprehensive suite of reforms. These initiatives, spanning taxation, labour, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), energy, foreign investment, and the legal framework, were strategically designed to enhance the resilience of the Indian economy amidst global uncertainties. The success of these policy shifts is underscored by India's robust 8.2% GDP growth in the second quarter of 2025, exceeding earlier projections.

GST 2.0: A Simplified Tax Regime

The most significant tax reform of the year was the September launch of Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0. This overhaul replaced the previous complex four-rate structure with a more streamlined two-rate system, comprising 5% and 18% slabs, alongside a specific 40% rate for select items. These changes were instrumental in reducing compliance burdens and lowering costs for consumers. The simplified rate structure is also credited with supporting consumption, evidenced by record Diwali sales reaching ₹6.05 lakh crore. Projections indicate that GST revenues for the fiscal year 2025-26 are set to surpass budgeted estimates, reflecting improved economic activity.

Income Tax Reform: Relief and Simplification

In a move to support the middle class, the Union Budget introduced substantial income tax relief, eliminating tax liability for individuals earning up to ₹12 lakh annually. This fiscal measure was accompanied by a complete replacement of the old Income Tax Act. The prior act, with its extensive amendments and sections, was superseded by a new, more concise Act featuring significantly fewer sections and words, aiming for greater clarity and accessibility.

Labour Reform: Modernizing Worker Regulations

Consolidating 29 existing laws into four overarching labour codes was another cornerstone of the 2025 reform agenda. These codes focus on enhancing aspects of wages, industrial relations, social security, and workplace safety. A key objective is to foster an environment that encourages greater female workforce participation and helps reduce unemployment rates across the nation. Significantly, businesses with fewer than 300 employees are now permitted to manage layoffs and closures without prior government approval, a notable increase from the previous threshold of 100 workers. This change aims to provide businesses with greater operational flexibility.

MSME Reform: Expanding Growth Opportunities

The definition of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) underwent a crucial revision, raising investment and turnover limits to facilitate their growth. Micro enterprises can now have investments up to ₹2.5 crore and turnover up to ₹10 crore, a substantial increase from the previous ₹1 crore and ₹5 crore limits, respectively. Medium enterprises saw their investment limits rise from ₹50 crore to ₹125 crore and turnover from ₹250 crore to ₹500 crore. Additionally, the credit guarantee cover for micro and small enterprises was doubled to ₹10 crore, enhancing their access to finance.

SHANTI Bill and Jan Vishwas Law: Opening New Sectors and Decriminalizing Offenses

Parliament passed the SHANTI Bill, officially the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill. This landmark legislation ends the state's monopoly in the nuclear sector, paving the way for private and foreign investment in civil nuclear projects and introducing a revised civil liability framework. The Jan Vishwas law continued its momentum, with the government decriminalizing over 200 minor offenses and repealing several outdated laws. A third phase of Jan Vishwas is anticipated, aiming to decriminalize even more provisions, thereby reducing the compliance burden on citizens and businesses.

FDI Reform and Employment Guarantee

Foreign direct investment (FDI) saw significant liberalization, particularly through a new insurance law allowing 100% FDI in insurance companies. This move is poised to attract substantial foreign capital and foster increased competition within the sector. In parallel, the Employment Guarantee Law, also known as the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission Act Gramin, expanded guaranteed workdays for rural households from 100 to 125 days, bolstering rural infrastructure development and livelihoods.

Legal and Regulatory Overhaul

The legal framework received a modern update with the introduction of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, replacing the Indian Penal Code of 1860. This new law addresses contemporary challenges like cyberterrorism, organised crime, economic sabotage, and gender-based violence. It also formally recognizes digital evidence, mandates e-FIRs, and sets crucial timelines for trial completion. Furthering the agenda of reducing regulatory burdens, quality control orders were reviewed, mandatory compliance was removed for 76 products, and over 200 products were identified for deregulation. These efforts significantly ease the operational environment for MSMEs and exporters.

Impact

These sweeping reforms are expected to have a profound positive impact on the Indian economy. By simplifying tax structures, reducing compliance burdens, encouraging investment, and modernizing legal frameworks, the government aims to foster ease of doing business and ease of living. This should translate into increased economic growth, greater employment opportunities, enhanced foreign investment, and a more robust and resilient Indian market. The collective effect is anticipated to boost investor confidence and drive long-term economic prosperity.
