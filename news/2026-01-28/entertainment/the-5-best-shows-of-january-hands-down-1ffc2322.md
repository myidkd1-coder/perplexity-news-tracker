## Full Article
Snowpocalypse has come and gone (though I'm sure there will be another one soon enough). Thankfully, there's plenty of great streaming content to keep us occupied for four more snowpocalypses.

January 2026 has brought us some stellar shows—The Pitt, Steal, The Traitors. It's also given us some misses—anyone else think The Beauty is a little too gross and A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is, well, kinda boring?

Here, the five best shows of January, hands-down, plus where to stream them. (I even included a few runners-up, so don't get too mad at me if your fave didn't make the top five.)
