## Summary
Ranks the five standout TV shows from February 2026, sorting hits from misses like Love Story and The Last Thing He Told Me season two, with streaming details.

## Full Article
January was a stellar month for must-watch TV shows. I'm talking The Pitt, Traitors, Steal and PONIES. But then February showed up and gave us a whole new slew of quality shows (I'm going to be talking about that bonkers Tyra Banks docuseries for a while...).

With so many new and returning shows arriving, it's kinda hard to keep track of what to watch. Love Story...not really my thing. The Last Thing He Told Me season two...fine, but did anyone really ask for this?

That's why I've sorted through the hits and misses to deliver you the five best shows of February 2026, hand-down, plus where to watch them. (Sorry, Bridgerton fans. Season four didn't make the list.)

If there's one thing Tyra Banks has always known how to do well, it's how to become a meme. From I was rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! to her newest I'm wildly unfazed and unapologetic documentary memes, she's figured out how to stay in the spotlight, for better or worse.

My favorite, and perhaps the most infuriating, show of the month has to be the highly bingable Netflix docuseries Reality Check: Inside America's Next Top Model. We get all the dirt and behind-the-scenes details from the reality show that, to offer an understatement, doesn't hold up so well anymore.

We hear from traumatized former contestants, sleighted former judges (like Jay Manuel and Miss J) and the runway queen herself, Tyra Banks. What we don't hear is anything remotely like an apology from Tyra...

If you loved Derry Girls as much as I did (OMG, you haven't seen it?! Go watch now!), you're going to be just as obsessed with this new comedy thriller from DG creator Lisa McGee.

Three childhood friends get a mysterious message alerting them to the fact that the fourth member of their group has died under strange circumstances. It would only be natural for them to attend her wake to grieve, no? No. They're more interested in making sure that a long-buried secret doesn't come to light.

This show is super quirky and funny, while still providing plenty of mystery. It's another easy-to-binge option that managed to slip under the radar when it debuted earlier in February. Fortunately, those who have seen it are giving it its flowers as much as I am—it has a 93 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

When PureWow sat down with actress Shailene Woodley last fall, she definitely couldn't share any secrets about Paradise season two. “I can't tell you anything about it. I definitely can't,” she said with a grin. “But I’m just so excited.”

And fans have been equally as excited for the return of the breakout hit series starring Sterling K. Brown, Julianne Nicholson and James Marsden. Without giving away any season one spoilers, this show is nothing like what it seems at the beginning. It is twist- and drama-filled. Things end with a well-earned answer to the season's big whodunnit, and now, things are picking up right where they left off.

Ok, y'all, this show is steamy and tense. Boy meets girl in a grocery store. 56 days later, an unidentifiable body is discovered decaying in a bathtub. Who does the body belong to? Is it the boy, the girl or neither? Is one of them responsible for the person's gruesome death?

Told through twisty and fun flashbacks and flash-forwards, 56 Days jumps through the timeline of Ciara and Oliver's relationship. Things don't appear to be what they seem from the get-go, with intense and sinister music underscoring what would otherwise be romantic moments. Oliver appears to be hiding a massive secret regarding his past and women, and Ciara seems to have quite the history herself.

A warning: the murder scene is not for the faint of heart. And just wait for the twist at the end of episode one...

30 Rock fans may have a bit of deja vu here. This brand-new sitcom comes from the same creators and stars Tracy Morgan playing a very Tracy Jordan-esque character. Here, Morgan is a former football star who fell from grace after a major scandal. Now, he's trying to redeem his image by starring in a documentary about himself. Hijinks ensue.

Joining him in these antics? Erika Alexander, Bobby Moynihan and Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe.

Honestly, this show is really fun. It's got that same silly yet smart humor that 30 Rock notoriously delivered. And in a season of thrillers and dark documentaries, Reggie Dinkins is a much-welcomed beacon of laughter.

The Runners-Up

Looking for other great shows to watch? February also delivered with these solid selects:

The Night Agent season three on Netflix

The 'Burbs on Peacock

Scrubs revival on ABC
