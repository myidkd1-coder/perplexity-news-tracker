The holy month of Ramadan is all set to begin across the world and Muslims are waiting eagerly for the sighting of the moon to begin fasting in 2026. According to the Islamic lunar calendar, Ramadan is expected to begin on February 18th or 19th this year. If the moon is sighted on Wednesday evening, February 18th, the first fast will be observed on Thursday, February 19th.

The holy month lasts approximately 29–30 days and culminates in Eid ul-Fitr celebrations.However, in Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the moon is often sighted a day earlier than in India.
