Rafah border reopens as UN officials warn of ongoing violence in Gaza

In Gaza, the Rafah border crossing reopened today – marking a rare moment of relief amid continuing violence.

While the reopening offers a lifeline for humanitarian aid and limited movement, the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) acting director in Gaza Sam Rose, warned of “competing dynamics,” noting that despite this positive progress, 30 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes over the past 24 hours during a declared ceasefire.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini described the truce as “a ceasefire in name only,” saying nearly 500 people have been killed since it began, including more than 100 children.

“A ceasefire means guns fall silent and give way to efforts to end the war,” Mr. Lazzarini said.

Meanwhile, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) convened a meeting with major philanthropic organizations in Kuwait, including the Kuwait Red Crescent Society and International Islamic Charity Organization, to coordinate support for Gaza’s urgent humanitarian needs and early recovery.

The discussions focused on restoring essential services, livelihoods, and housing for displaced families.

Ukraine: Civilian mine workers killed and injured in Russian attack

In eastern Ukraine, a Russian drone attack killed 12 and injured 16 civilian mine workers commuting home from their shift on Sunday afternoon, reported the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU).

Approximately 65 kilometers from the frontline, the mine workers were travelling by bus on a regular commuter route from the Pavlohrad mine through Ternivka, when multiple Russian drones struck the road near the vehicle over several minutes.

The explosions blew out the windows of the bus and riddled it with fragments, killing and injuring passengers. Other civilians driving nearby, and individuals who rushed to assist victims of the first explosion, were also reportedly among the casualties.

According to the HRMMU, a coal miner who was injured in the attack recounted climbing out of a bus window after the first explosion, hearing screams from inside, and then a second blast occurring a few minutes later.

Danielle Bell, head of the rights monitoring mission, emphasised that mine workers, like all civilians, should be able to travel to and from work without fear.

She said that the incident highlights the dangers civilians face when hostilities extend into areas of everyday life, even well beyond the active fighting zone.

Global space leaders convene in Vienna on peaceful future of outer space

And in Vienna, Member States are gathering for scientific and technical discussions at the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS).

The week-long session brings together diplomats, scientists, and space sector leaders.

It focuses on some of the most urgent technical and scientific challenges in outer space, including space debris, planetary defence, and the use of nuclear power sources in space.

This year’s meeting is expected to discuss a wide range of issues, from space-based disaster management and global navigation satellite systems to the long-term sustainability of space activities.

A highlight of the programme is a special industry symposium on 10 February, which will launch the first-ever UN Space Debates on how space can support sustainable development on Earth.
