## Full Article
India’s External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar lays out the hard realities of India’s foreign policy in a rapidly shifting world. Speaking in Pune, Jaishankar explains why engaging the United States, managing China, and reassuring Russia have all become more complicated — and why Europe and India’s neighbourhood now demand even greater diplomatic focus. From India’s role as a first responder in Sri Lanka and a vaccine lifeline during COVID, to energy and food support during the Ukraine war, Jaishankar underscores how India delivers when global systems fail. He also addresses the global demand for Indian talent, calling it a strong “brand,” and urges young Indians to see the world as a global workplace. Touching on the Gulf, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and India’s deep civilisational imprint abroad, Jaishankar stresses the need for clarity, strategic choices, and long-term vision. On leadership, he credits Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision as the defining force shaping India’s global standing. Watch the full remarks here.
