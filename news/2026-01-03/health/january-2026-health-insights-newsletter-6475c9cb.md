## Summary

## Full Article
A new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows that five basic lifestyle habits can significantly extend the number of years people live without chronic diseases. The research followed more than 100,000 participants over several decades. It found that individuals who adopted these habits by age 50 gained more than a decade of life free from major illnesses like cancer, heart disease, or type 2 diabetes. The five habits identified in the study are simple and familiar: eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy body weight, avoid smoking, and drink alcohol in moderation.

According to the findings, women who practiced four or five of these habits at age 50 lived an average of 34.4 more years without chronic disease. In contrast, women who followed none of the habits lived only 23.7 disease-free years. For men, the difference was similar: 31.1 years of healthy life with the habits, compared to 23.5 years without them. That’s nearly a decade of additional life spent without the burden of serious illness.

The study also identified which behaviors had the greatest influence. Smoking and obesity were most strongly associated with a shorter disease-free lifespan. On the other hand, even modest improvements in diet and physical activity contributed to better outcomes. A healthy diet was measured using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Regular exercise was defined as at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day. Moderate alcohol consumption was defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two for men.

Lead author Dr. Yanping Li emphasized that the study provides strong evidence that lifestyle choices can not only extend life but also improve its quality. Senior author Dr. Frank Hu noted that public health policies supporting access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and smoking cessation resources could help more people adopt these behaviors. The implications of this research are far-reaching. Chronic diseases account for the majority of healthcare costs and affect millions of lives. If more people adopted even a few of these habits, the potential impact on public health would be substantial. The study serves as a reminder that the path to better health is often within reach. Better health starts with the choices we make every day.

Whether it’s choosing a salad over fast food, taking a walk after dinner, or cutting back on alcohol, small and consistent changes can lead to a longer, healthier life. The message is clear: these five habits are not just about adding years to your life; they are also about adding life to your years.
