The Somnath Swabhiman Parv, held from 8 to 11 January 2026, is being organised in Somnath. It is being held to remember the countless citizens of India whose sacrifice to defend the Temple continues to inspire the cultural consciousness of future generations.



The programme marks the 1,000th anniversary of Mahmud of Ghazni's invasion of the Somnath Temple in 1026. Despite repeated attempts to destroy it over centuries, the Somnath Temple stands today as a powerful symbol of resilience, faith, and national pride, owing to the collective resolve and efforts to restore it to its ancient glory.



A government release stated that, after independence, Sardar Patel led the effort to restore the Temple. One of the most important milestones in this journey of revival was achieved in 1951, when the restored Somnath Temple was formally opened to devotees in the presence of the then President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad. The 75th anniversary of this historic restoration in 2026 adds special significance to the Somnath Swabhiman Parv.



The celebrations witnesses the participation of hundreds of saints from across the country, along with 72 hours of continuous chanting of 'Om' within the temple premises.
