"Get Real With Me" host Alix Earle lived up to her YouTube series name Tuesday night ... the influencer used her TikTok followers as an emotional-support boyfriend following her breakup from Braxton Berrios.

Turning the camera on herself mid-spiral, she announced, "I'm just going to start talking to you guys like you're my boyfriend."

As you know, Alix and Braxton split last month after 2 years together. Since then, she's been committed to remaining single for a while ... and it's apparently been rough.

She admitted, "I can't sleep right now ... I feel like just not having that stability of a male partner -- or just even someone to talk to or distract me -- is just so weird.”
