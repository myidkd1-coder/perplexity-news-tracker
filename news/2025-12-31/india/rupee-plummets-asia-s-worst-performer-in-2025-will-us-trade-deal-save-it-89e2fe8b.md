Rupee Faces Steepest Decline in Asia Amid Global Headwinds

The Indian Rupee concluded 2025 with a significant depreciation of approximately 5%, marking its worst performance in three years and earning the title of Asia's worst-performing currency. The domestic currency experienced substantial volatility throughout the year, reflecting a complex interplay of international trade policies, geopolitical instability, and domestic economic factors.

The Core Issue

The rupee's weakness was largely attributed to concerns stemming from the Trump administration's policies, notably the imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian goods. This action, coupled with shocks from an H-1B visa fee hike, directly pressured the currency. Further compounding the challenges were escalating geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Iran conflict, and existing India-Pakistan tensions. Consistent foreign outflows from Indian equity markets, amounting to $17.9 billion in 2025, also played a crucial role in weakening the rupee.

Financial Implications

The depreciation has significant financial implications for India. Higher import costs, particularly for oil and essential goods, could fuel domestic inflation. The weakening rupee makes external commercial borrowings (ECBs) more expensive for Indian corporates, impacting their profitability and balance sheets. This trend has prompted Indian companies to increase their hedging strategies for foreign exposures, with the share of unhedged ECBs decreasing notably.

Market Reaction

While the article doesn't detail specific stock market reactions, the currency's slide and foreign outflows suggest a cautious or negative sentiment among foreign investors. The breach of psychological levels, such as 90/$ on December 3rd, indicates market stress.

Official Statements and Responses

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) actively intervened in the market to support the rupee but adopted a strategy focused on curbing disorderly spikes rather than defending specific exchange rate levels. The RBI's latest bulletin indicated that the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) dropped to its lowest since February 2019, suggesting the rupee was undervalued against a basket of 40 currencies. While the RBI's dollar forward book saw increases, it was managed down from earlier peaks.

Expert Analysis

Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, noted that rupee volatility was sentiment-driven by trade deal uncertainties, with RBI intervention being nuanced. Kunal Sodhani, treasury head at Shinhan Bank, explained that global currencies strengthening contributed to the rupee's larger declines against the euro and pound. Ritesh Bhansali, deputy CEO at Mecklai Financial Services, highlighted the RBI's decisive action against speculative positions but also noted the central bank's limits due to reserves and weak sentiment. Anitha Rangan, chief economist at RBL Bank, and Anindya Banerjee, head of commodity and currency research at Kotak Securities, provided forecasts for 2026, anticipating continued pressure influenced by the dollar's strength and trade deal progress.

Future Outlook

Economists and currency analysts widely expect the rupee to face downward pressure until a trade deal is signed with the United States. Anitha Rangan projects the rupee to trade between 90-93 for 2026, expecting appreciation only later in the year. Anindya Banerjee forecasts the INR could hit 92 in January and March 2026, while Kunal Sodhani anticipates a trading range of 88.20-94.00 for the year.

Impact

The continued depreciation of the Indian Rupee poses a risk to India's economic stability. Elevated import costs could exacerbate inflation, impacting consumers and businesses. Foreign investment sentiment may remain subdued until trade uncertainties are resolved, potentially hindering economic growth. The RBI's approach suggests a tolerance for managed volatility, prioritizing stability over defending rigid exchange rate levels. The impact rating reflects the significant potential for imported inflation and effects on trade dynamics.

Impact Rating: 8/10
