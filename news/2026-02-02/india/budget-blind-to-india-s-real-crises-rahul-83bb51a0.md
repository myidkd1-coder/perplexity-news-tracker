New Delhi: Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the Union Budget for 2026-27 is “blind to India’s real crises”, and highlighted how the youth are without jobs, manufacturing is falling, and farmers are in distress. “Youth without jobs. Falling manufacturing. Investors are pulling out capital. Household savings are plummeting. Farmers in distress. Looming global shocks — all ignored,” the Congress leader said. “A Budget that refuses course correction, blind to India’s real crises,” Gandhi said in a post on X. In her speech, Union Finance Minister Sitharaman announced that the target for capex will be raised to Rs 12.2 lakh crore for FY27 from Rs 11.2 lakh crore earmarked for the current fiscal year.
