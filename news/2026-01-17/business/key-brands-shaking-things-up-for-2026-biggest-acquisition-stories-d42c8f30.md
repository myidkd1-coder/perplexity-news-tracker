Big brands are making some big moves this year to get ahead of rising inflation and tariff woes.

This year kicked off with several acquisitions, and it seems businesses are joining forces and strategizing their survival for the year ahead. Last year certainly had its challenges — the understatement of the year — and wholesale vendors and sales rep agencies in the industry wasted no time putting business plans together that will hopefully see them through another year, and decade more.

If you missed the biggest acquisition and business strategy stories, you can check them out here.

First, the biggest news of the year is The Link Companies’ acquisition of NextGen Dallas. Though Next Gen Dallas will continue to operate under its established name and leadership, with Kim Pounds continuing on as president, the acquisition helps strengthen both sales rep agencies by uniting their resources.

This, of course, comes on the heels of the late 2024 acquisition of OneCoast by rep group Ivystone.

Other stories that kicked off the new year included Evergreen Enterprises’ acquisition of Woodstock Chimes and Darren Gygi reclaiming ownership of its art and home brand after Sullivans’ closure. Sullivans announced in June 2025 that it was seeking to sell in the wake of tariffs. Transpac Brands ended up buying the brand’s floral business shortly after and relaunched the category at this month’s markets.

Transpac Brands also moved across the country to streamline its operations for 2026. Though the move was announced in late 2025, it’s another example of a big brand making a big business decision to improve its standing in 2026 and navigate the troubling waters of increasing freight and operations costs.

Crossroads Family of Brands also expanded this year after its acquisition of The Grandparent Gift Co., adding to the brand’s collection of sentimental and specialty gifts.
