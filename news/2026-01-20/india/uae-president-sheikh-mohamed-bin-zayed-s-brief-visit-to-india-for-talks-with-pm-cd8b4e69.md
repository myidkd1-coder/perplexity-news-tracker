Trump STRIKES Europe; Top 8 U.S. Allies TARGETED With Tariffs & Big Greenland Ultimatum ISSUED

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he would charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European countries because of opposition to U.S. control of Greenland. He said in a social media post that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would face the tariff, which would be raised to 25% on June 1 if a deal is not in place for “the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland” by the United States. Trump said the United States has long subsidized Denmark and other European Union countries by not imposing tariffs and argued it is time for Denmark to “give back.” He claimed China and Russia seek influence over Greenland and asserted that only the United States can protect the territory.
