Oral cholera vaccines have played a critical role in efforts to prevent and control the severe and potentially life-threatening diarrheal disease. But they could be better. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends three licensed vaccines for use in areas experiencing cholera outbreaks or where the disease is endemic. All three are killed, whole-cell vaccines that provide protection against cholera by stimulating the intestinal immune response to the Vibrio cholerae bacterium, which spreads through contaminated water and food and produces toxins that cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.
