India is all set for a nationwide Bharat Bandh or general strike on Thursday, 12 February 2026. Given the condition, travellers and daily commuters are suggested to plan ahead to avoid unexpected travel disruptions. The one-day bandh is being called by a coalition of over 10 central trade unions and several farmers’ organisations to protest new labour codes, among other issues. As per the unions, tomorrow’s strike will affect more than 600 districts.All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Amarjeet Kaur was quoted by PTI, "not less than 30 crore workers will participate in the strike called on February 12 (Thursday)."Reason behind the Bharat BandhSeveral trade unions along with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) will lead the bandh. Their main demands are regarding newly implemented labour codes and how it will weaken worker rights. While the government has acknowledged the right to protest, it has emphasised maintaining law and order making it a peaceful protest.As per PTI, the impact of the proposed strike will be seen in Odisha and Assam.These two states would be completely shut down and other states will also have a huge impact, Kaur said.“Odisha and Assam are expected to be completely shut, and other states will see widespread participation,” she said.Public Transport and RoadsTravel on public transport may be disrupted:In many states, state-run buses and taxis may run on limited schedules or not at all in some areas like Kerala and Odisha.Road blockades are possible in many cities, potentially slowing traffic around protest sites.What’s likely to be shutMajor public-sector bank employees have extended their support and participation in the strike. Major banks have issued alerts warning of potential service disruptions.It’s not a national holiday:So, schools and colleges are not automatically closed across the country.However, because transport services may be affected, several institutions in states like Kerala, Karnataka and Odisha are likely to remain shut.Local markets and shops may choose to close voluntarily in protest areas.What will likely remain openEssential services are expected to continue, including:Hospitals, and ambulance services.Pharmacies and essential supply chains (like milk and newspapers)Utilities such as water, electricity and emergency services (fire departments) are exempt from strike actions.Here’s how travellers can prepare:Check railway and flight timings.Use private vehicles where possible, especially for early morning travel.Avoid protest sites due to roadblocks.Monitor local news and follow official advisories.Travellers are encouraged to stay updated with real-time notifications and rely on official information.
