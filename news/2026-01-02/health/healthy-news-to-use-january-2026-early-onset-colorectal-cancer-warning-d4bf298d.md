Nutrition advice floods social media daily, but one issue deserves sharper focus: ultra-processed foods.Pasteurization makes milk safe, and fortification with vitamin D strengthens bones. But ultra-processed products—packaged snacks, sugary drinks, fried fast food—strip away nutrients and add unhealthy fats, salt and chemicals.Ultra-processed foods have long been tied to obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. Now, research shows they may be fueling a troubling rise in colorectal cancer among younger adults. A Harvard-led study found women who consumed the most ultra-processed foods faced a 45% higher risk of precancerous polyps compared with those who ate the least. Other studies show similar increases, underscoring how diet choices today shape health outcomes tomorrow.Colorectal cancer rates are climbing in people under 50, even as they decline among older adults. Ultra-processed foods now account for more than half of daily calories for many Americans, fueling inflammation and gut disruption. Public health experts warn that without changes, early-onset colorectal cancer could double every 15 years.Read food labels. Limit additives such as high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and nitrates. Choose fresh, whole foods whenever possible. A baked potato remains a healthy staple; French fries drenched in oil and salt do not.Ultra-processed foods may be cheap and convenient, but the evidence is clear: they carry a cost younger generations cannot afford to ignore.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has prioritized finding possible causes of autism, including launching the Autism Data Science Initiative. Research is ongoing regarding which behaviors are safe, including examinations of medications taken during pregnancy. What is known right now is that autism rates are rising. As of the latest data, one in 31 children in the United States has autism, according to the organization Autism Speaks. This is up from the previous rate of one in 36. Around the world, one in 100 children are diagnosed with autism. Boys are nearly four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls, and those who are American Indian or members of Alaska Native racial or ethnic groups have a higher prevalence of autism than others.Family history tends to be a risk factor for various diseases, but cervical cancer does not seem to be one of them. A recent report in Medical News Today noted that a person is not more likely to develop cervical cancer if a parent or close relative has had the disease. Data from the World Health Organization indicates that roughly 70 percent of cervical cancer cases can be traced to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is often transmitted through sexual intercourse. The Cleveland Clinic notes there are more than 100 types of HPV, and some strains of the virus can lead to cervical cancer. People concerned about cervical cancer are urged to speak with their physicians about what can be done to reduce their risk, a discussion that may include suggestions on lowering the chances of contracting HPV.Regular physical activity is often associated with immediate effects, and rightfully so. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, physical activity can improve cognition and thinking, reduce short-term feelings of anxiety, and make it easier for people to manage their weight. But physical activity also boasts some notable long-term benefits, particularly in regard to disease prevention. The CDC notes that regular exercise can reduce risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, infectious diseases like COVID-19 and pneumonia, and various forms of cancer, including cancers of the breast, colon, kidneys, and lungs.
