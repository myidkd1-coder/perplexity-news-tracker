Govt must be compelled to "desist from signing any agreement that is harmful to the interests of Indian workers, farmers..." the party said in a statement.CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said, "The trade deal framework represents a meek surrender by Modi govt to Trump's diktat.
