## Full Article
The Division I Cabinet on Wednesday approved changes to the transfer windows in several sports, including men's and women's basketball, men's wrestling, men's ice hockey, and men's and women's track and field. The changes to the notification-of-transfer windows were recommended by the respective sport oversight committees.

Basketball

At the recommendation of the Men's and Women's Basketball Oversight Committees, the transfer windows in men's and women's basketball will open for a 15-day period the day after the championship game for the respective NCAA tournament. The changes are effective immediately.

When a head coaching change occurs, a 15-day period will open five days after the new head coach is hired or publicly announced. If a new head coach is not announced within 30 days of the previous head coach's departure — and the 31st day after the head coach's departure is after the championship game — a 15-day window will open. The additional head coach departure window is available only after the basketball transfer window opens through Jan. 2.

In basketball, midyear transfers are not eligible to compete at a second school if they enrolled at an NCAA school during the first academic term, regardless of whether they competed there.

Men's wrestling

In men's wrestling, the transfer window will be 30 days, beginning April 1 each year. The previous window, which was 45 days, began after selections for the Division I Men's Wrestling Championships.

Men's ice hockey

In men's ice hockey, the transfer window will be 15 days, starting the Monday after the final of the Division I Men's Ice Hockey Championship.

When a head coaching change occurs, an additional 15-day period will open five days after the new head coach is announced. If a new head coach is not announced within 30 days of the previous head coach's departure — and the 31st day after the head coach's departure is after the championship game — a 15-day window will open. The additional head coach departure window is available only after the ice hockey transfer window opens through Jan. 2.

The Cabinet directed the Women's Ice Hockey Committee to consider whether it supports similar changes to the notification-of-transfer process for Division I women's ice hockey student-athletes.

Track and field

In men's and women's track and field, the oversight committee recommended the removal of the transfer window that previously opened after the indoor track and field season. Moving forward, track and field student-athletes will still have a 30-day window that opens the day after selections for the Division I Men's and Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championships, as well as during windows that occur at the end of the fall.

New opportunities for women's sports

The Cabinet unanimously voted to create National Collegiate Championships in acrobatics and tumbling and in stunt. For the championships to officially be approved, Divisions II and III also must approve them at their respective business sessions Friday.

Additionally, the Cabinet unanimously approved the addition of women's flag football to the Emerging Sports for Women program, effective immediately. Teams at schools that sponsor the sport this spring will count toward the requirement that 40 schools sponsor the sport and meet minimum contest requirements for it to be considered for an NCAA championship.
