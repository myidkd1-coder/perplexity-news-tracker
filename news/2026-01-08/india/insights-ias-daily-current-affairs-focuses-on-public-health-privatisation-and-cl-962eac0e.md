Subject: Health

Context: India’s public health system is under renewed scrutiny due to rising privatisation, chronic underfunding, and regulatory gaps, which are worsening health inequities and patient outcomes.

About Privatisation threatening India’s public health system :

What it is?

Privatisation in public health refers to the growing role of private hospitals, insurers, and corporate entities in financing, delivering, and training healthcare, often using public funds.

It includes public–private partnerships (PPPs), insurance-based purchasing of care, and expansion of private medical education.

Trends:

India spends only ~2.1% of GDP on public health (2023–24), among the lowest globally.

Over 60% of total health expenditure is out-of-pocket , pushing millions into poverty annually.

, pushing millions into poverty annually. Schemes like Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY increasingly reimburse private hospitals, diverting public funds.

increasingly reimburse private hospitals, diverting public funds. Private medical colleges charge ₹40–50 lakh+ for MBBS, reshaping medical priorities toward profit recovery.

Need for Privatisation in Public Health

Bridging tertiary care infrastructure gaps: Private hospitals supplement shortages in ICUs, cardiology, oncology, and renal care where public capacity is inadequate.

E.g. In Uttar Pradesh, district dialysis services are delivered through private hospitals empanelled under PPP models due to lack of public renal units.

Private hospitals supplement shortages in ICUs, cardiology, oncology, and renal care where public capacity is inadequate. In Uttar Pradesh, district dialysis services are delivered through private hospitals empanelled under PPP models due to lack of public renal units. Expanding access to advanced diagnostics: The private sector provides nearly 70% of high-end diagnostics (MRI, CT, PET scans), which public hospitals cannot rapidly scale.

E.g. Tier-2 cities rely predominantly on private diagnostic chains for cancer and neuro-imaging.

The private sector provides nearly (MRI, CT, PET scans), which public hospitals cannot rapidly scale. Tier-2 cities rely predominantly on private diagnostic chains for cancer and neuro-imaging. Driving technology adoption and innovation: Corporate hospitals act as early adopters of advanced medical technologies before public diffusion.

E.g. Apollo Hospitals pioneered robotic surgeries and AI-based cardiac risk tools, later informing national clinical benchmarks.

Rapid surge capacity during health emergencies : Private healthcare can quickly mobilise infrastructure and manpower during crises.

E.g. During COVID-19, private laboratories conducted ~45% of India’s RT-PCR tests, preventing systemic collapse.

Initiatives taken by the government

Ayushman Bharat programme PM-JAY for secondary/tertiary care insurance.

Health and Wellness Centres for primary care strengthening. National Health Policy 2017 Target of 2.5% GDP public health spending (yet to be achieved). Digital health push Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission for health records and interoperability. Medical education expansion Increase in government medical colleges and seats post-2014.

Challenges Associated with Privatisation:

Profit-driven clinical decision-making: Revenue targets incentivise unnecessary procedures and overtreatment.

E.g. Multiple state audits flagged unwarranted C-sections and hysterectomies in private hospitals.

Weak and uneven regulatory enforcement: Price caps and quality standards vary widely across States.

E.g. The same cardiac stent procedure shows 3–5x price variation across private hospitals.

Erosion of public health infrastructure : Public funds flow to private reimbursements instead of strengthening government facilities.

E.g. PM-JAY reimbursements often bypass underfunded district hospitals.

Commercialisation of medical education: High fees distort career choices away from public service and primary care.

E.g. Private MBBS seats costing ₹40 lakh–₹1 crore push doctors toward high-paying urban specialisations.

Way Ahead:

Rebuild public health as the primary provider: Increase public health spending to at least 3% of GDP with priority to government facilities.

E.g. Countries with strong public systems (UK, Thailand) show lower OOPE.

Strengthen primary care first: Treat most illnesses locally to reduce dependence on expensive tertiary care.

E.g. Ayushman Arogya Mandirs can address 80–90% of disease burden if fully staffed.

Tighten regulation of private providers: Enforce Standard Treatment Guidelines, audits, and transparent pricing.

Enforce Standard Treatment Guidelines, audits, and transparent pricing. Reorient insurance schemes toward public hospitals: Use PM-JAY funds to upgrade government infrastructure instead of passive purchasing.

Use PM-JAY funds to upgrade government infrastructure instead of passive purchasing. Reform medical education and workforce policy: Cap fees, mandate rural service, and prioritise skill-based clinical training.

Conclusion:

Privatisation can only be a supporting instrument, not the foundation of public health. Unchecked market logic deepens inequality and weakens state capacity. India’s health future depends on a strong public system with a tightly regulated private complement.

UPSC CURRENT AFFAIRS – 7 January 2026 GS GS Paper 3:

Subject: Environment

Context: The United Nations has declared 2026 as the International Year for Rangelands and Pastoralists, renewing global attention on grasslands.

Recent climate negotiations continue to prioritise forests, prompting debate on why grasslands must be integrated into national climate plans and NDCs.

About Grasslands and Climate Change 2026 :

What are grasslands?

Grasslands are open ecosystems dominated by grasses, with few or no trees, found across savannahs, steppes, prairies, and rangelands.

They cover ~40% of Earth’s land surface and support pastoral livelihoods, wildlife, and soil-based carbon storage.

Why grasslands matter in climate action?

Stable carbon sinks through underground sequestration : Nearly 90% of grassland carbon is stored below ground in deep root systems, protecting it from surface disturbances unlike forest biomass.

E.g. Stanford University (2025) found grassland soil carbon uptake rose by 8% under higher CO₂, while forest soils showed no comparable gain.

Fire resilience and carbon permanence: Forest fires release most stored carbon instantly, whereas grassland fires leave soil carbon intact, allowing rapid ecological recovery.

E.g. Western US prairie studies (2024–25) show grasslands remain net carbon sinks even under frequent fire regimes.

Natural climate cooling via albedo effect: Grasslands reflect more solar radiation than dark forest canopies, reducing local heat absorption and surface warming.

E.g. IPBES Land Report (2025) highlights grasslands’ cooling role in semi-arid climate zones.

Hydrological regulation and drought buffering: Dense grass roots act as sponges, improving groundwater recharge and reducing runoff during extreme rainfall events.

E.g. Senegal’s National Adaptation Plan (2025) restored 2 million hectares of grasslands in the Ferlo Reserve to curb drought–flood cycles.

Global policy bias: forests over grasslands

Forest-centric climate finance architecture : Global climate funds disproportionately target forests, sidelining grasslands despite comparable mitigation potential.

E.g. COP30 (Belém, Brazil) focused heavily on forests through the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF).

Global climate funds disproportionately target forests, sidelining grasslands despite comparable mitigation potential. COP30 (Belém, Brazil) focused heavily on forests through the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF). Institutional silos across UN conventions: Climate (UNFCCC), biodiversity (CBD), and desertification (UNCCD) operate separately, fragmenting grassland governance.

E.g. Grasslands receive stronger recognition under UNCCD COP16 (Saudi Arabia) than under UNFCCC negotiations.

Exclusion from Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): Most countries mention forests explicitly in NDCs while ignoring grasslands as carbon sinks.

E.g. India’s NDC targets 2.5–3 billion tonnes CO₂ sink via forests, omitting grasslands.

Misclassification as “wastelands”: Productive grasslands are officially labelled as degraded land, legitimising conversion.

E.g. India’s Wasteland Atlas historically included grazing commons and savannah ecosystems.

Implications of declining grasslands:

Accelerated biodiversity loss: Open-habitat species face “extinction by afforestation” when trees replace grasslands.

E.g. Brazil’s Cerrado loses grassland area twice as fast as the Amazon, threatening endemic fauna.

Weakened climate resilience : Degraded grasslands increase vulnerability to desertification and flash floods.

E.g. Australia’s desert rangelands (2024–25) show rising flood–drought volatility due to invasive buffel grass.

Loss of pollination services: Grasslands support pollinators critical to global food systems.

E.g. FAO estimates grassland-dependent pollinators support ~35% of global crop production.

Displacement of pastoral and indigenous communities: Conversion restricts mobility and traditional livelihoods.

E.g. Charanka Solar Park, Gujarat (2025) displaced semi-nomadic herders by fencing grassland commons.

The way forward:

Recognise grasslands as Open Natural Ecosystems (ONEs): Shift policy language from “wastelands” to ecologically valuable systems.

E.g. India (2026) moving toward ONE classification in land-use planning.

Integrate grasslands into NDCs: Explicit inclusion unlocks climate finance and policy priority.

E.g. Brazilian researchers (2025) urged inclusion of Cerrado grasslands in national NDC updates.

Adopt ecosystem-based climate planning: Balance forests, grasslands, wetlands, and mangroves in mitigation strategies.

E.g. WWF–IUCN report (COP30) recommended cross-biome carbon accounting.

Secure community land rights and governance: Indigenous stewardship improves ecological outcomes.

E.g. Indigenous Desert Alliance (Australia) uses cultural burning to protect desert grasslands.

Incentivise sustainable grazing and PES models: Reward soil carbon enhancement through pastoral practices.

E.g. India’s proposed National Rangeland Utilisation Policy (2025–26) aims to restore 120 million hectares.

Conclusion:

Grasslands are not empty lands but climate-critical ecosystems storing carbon, sustaining biodiversity, and supporting livelihoods. A forest-only climate strategy is scientifically incomplete and socially unjust. Integrating grasslands into NDCs and climate finance is essential for credible, resilient, and inclusive climate action.

Context: Online ticket booking for 170+ centrally protected monuments and museums has been enabled by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) platform.

About Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) :

What it is?

ONDC is an open, interoperable digital network that enables buying and selling of goods and services across platforms using open protocols, without platform monopolies.

Launched in: April 2022

Ministry:

Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)

Ministry of Commerce and Industry

Aim:

Democratise digital commerce by breaking platform silos.

Create a level playing field for sellers (especially MSMEs), buyers, and service providers.

Promote inclusivity, competition, innovation, and cost efficiency in e-commerce.

How ONDC works?

ONDC functions as a decentralised digital network, not a central marketplace. It does not own listings, control sellers, or process orders; instead, it connects independent platforms through common digital rules.

Using open protocols and standardised APIs, any buyer app can discover products or services listed on any seller app across the network, regardless of the company that built the app. Once a buyer places an order, different specialised participants handle each part of the transaction. Buyer Applications provide the customer interface for search, price comparison, and ordering. Seller Applications manage product catalogues, inventory, pricing, and order confirmation. Logistics Providers handle pickup, delivery, and tracking across regions. Technology Enablers supply the digital infrastructure, integrations, and tools.

Because all participants follow the same open standards, any ONDC-compliant app can seamlessly discover, connect, and transact with any other, ensuring interoperability, competition, and freedom of choice for users.

Subject: Science and Technology

Context: Indian scientists have developed the first supercomputer-powered simulation that successfully captures the Mpemba effect, resolving a long-standing scientific paradox of hot water freezing faster than cold.

About Mpemba Effect :

What it is?

The Mpemba effect refers to the counterintuitive phenomenon where hot water freezes faster than cold water under specific experimental conditions.

Named after Erasto Mpemba, a Tanzanian student who reported it scientifically in 1969, though it was noted earlier by Aristotle, Bacon, and Descartes.

How it works?

The Mpemba effect occurs because water’s behaviour is shaped by more than just its temperature. When water is heated, its physical and molecular state changes, which can influence how it freezes later. Evaporation: Hot water loses some mass as vapour, so less water remains to freeze, speeding up the process. Dissolved gases: Heating drives out dissolved gases, subtly changing the water’s freezing characteristics. Convection currents: Temperature gradients in hot water create internal circulation that enhances heat loss. Supercooling : Hot water may begin freezing at a higher temperature than cold water, allowing it to solidify sooner. Environmental effects: Hot containers can alter their surroundings, improving overall cooling efficiency.

Since these factors vary with conditions, no single mechanism explains the effect universally; different processes dominate in different situations.

Applications:

Advances understanding of non-equilibrium physics and phase transitions.

Improves climate and cryosphere modelling, including ice formation processes.

Relevant to industrial freezing, food processing, and materials science.

Demonstrates the power of supercomputing in resolving classical scientific paradoxes.

Subject: Science and Technology

Context: India’s focus on Biomanufacturing and Bio-foundry has reached a climax in early 2026 with the operationalization of massive PLA (Polylactic Acid) facilities.

About Biomaterials India :

What it is?

Biomaterials are substances derived wholly or partly from biological sources (plants, fungi, bacteria) or engineered using biological processes (fermentation) to replace or interact with conventional, petroleum-based materials.

They are designed to be either chemically identical to existing materials or entirely novel with unique biodegradable properties.

Origin and Production:

They originate from renewable feedstocks such as sugarcane, maize, agricultural residues, and even waste like temple flowers or seafood shells.

Microorganisms like bacteria (Xanthomonas) or fungi are often used in fermentation vessels to convert sugars into building blocks like lactic acid, which is then polymerized into solid materials.

Categories and Types:

Drop-in Biomaterials: These are the plug-and-play versions. They are chemically identical to petroleum-based plastics (like Bio-PET ). Their biggest advantage is that they can be used in existing manufacturing lines without any machinery upgrades.

Drop-out Biomaterials: These are chemically unique alternatives, such as PLA (Polylactic Acid) . While they replace traditional plastics, they require separate end-of-life systems, like industrial composting facilities, because they don’t mix with standard plastic recycling streams.

Novel Biomaterials: These are the super-materials of the future. They possess properties nature didn’t intend for industrial use, such as self-healing composites for construction or 3D-printed bioactive scaffolds that help human bones regrow.



Key Characteristics:

Renewability: They utilize a “current” carbon cycle; crops absorb CO 2 while growing, which offsets the carbon released during production. Biocompatibility: Many biomaterials are non-toxic and “immune-silent,” allowing them to be used inside the human body for stents or drug delivery without rejection. Tunability: Through genetic engineering of microbes, scientists can “program” the strength, flexibility, or degradation rate of the material. Biodegradability: Unlike microplastics that persist for centuries, many biomaterials can be broken down by bacteria into water and CO 2 within months under the right conditions. Composite Potential: They can be combined (like lignin and cellulose in wood) to create high-strength, lightweight materials for the automotive and aerospace industries.

Applications:

Packaging: Single-use plastic bans are being met with seaweed-based or corn-starch-based wrappers.

Single-use plastic bans are being met with seaweed-based or corn-starch-based wrappers. Agriculture: Mulch films that farmers can simply plow back into the soil after the harvest.
