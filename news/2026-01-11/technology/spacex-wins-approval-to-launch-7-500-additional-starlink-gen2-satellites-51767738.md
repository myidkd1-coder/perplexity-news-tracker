## Summary
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission has authorized SpaceX to deploy 7,500 more second-generation Starlink satellites, expanding its global broadband constellation. The move is expected to boost capacity, improve coverage, and support new services as SpaceX races competitors in low-Earth-orbit connectivity.

## Full Article
In Brief

The Federal Communications Commission announced Friday that it has given SpaceX approval to launch another 7,500 of its second generation Starlink satellites, for a total of 15,000 satellites worldwide.

Beyond simply allowing SpaceX to launch more satellites and expand its high-speed internet coverage, the FCC says its decision also means Starlink satellites can operate across five frequencies and to provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States, along with supplemental coverage in the U.S.

Reuters reports that SpaceX had requested approval for an additional 15,000 satellites, but the FCC said it would “defer authorization of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites.”

SpaceX must launch 50% of the approved Starlink satellites by December 1, 2028, and the remaining 50% by December 2031, the FCC says.
