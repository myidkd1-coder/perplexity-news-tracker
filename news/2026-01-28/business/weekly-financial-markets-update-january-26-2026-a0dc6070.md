Top Three Market Headlines

Consumer Sentiment Improves in January: The Index of Consumer Sentiment, published by the University of Michigan, rose 3.5 points in January to 56.4, its second straight increase and the highest reading in five months. Improved sentiment was reported across a range of consumer characteristics, including income level, age, and political affiliation. Moreover, respondents were more optimistic about both current economic conditions and future expectations. At the same time, the Index was still more than 20% off its level from a year ago, with consumers noting continued anxiety about high prices and the labor market.

Arctic Freeze Drives Surge in Natural Gas Prices: U.S. natural gas prices jumped more than 60% last week on spot trading markets (where commodities are traded for immediate delivery) amid the Arctic freeze settling over the United States. Traders expected the low temperatures and snow and ice storms to drive a sharp increase in heating demand and raise the risk of production outages. Notably, however the rally came on the heels of a sustained drop in prices over the last month, and the price at week's end, $5.04 per MMBtu (million British thermal units), remained below that recorded in early December of $5.30.

Weekly Initial Unemployment Claims Trending Down: The Department of Labor reported last week that initial claims for state unemployment benefits in the U.S. totaled 200,000 for the week ending January 17th, virtually flat with the prior week. The reading extended a recent downward trend in applications for unemployment benefits, which can be an indicator of layoffs and the strength of the job market, over the last several months of 2025 and into 2026. Specifically, the latest four-week moving average of 201,500 is the lowest level since January of 2024, and compares to a peak of 245,000 last June.
