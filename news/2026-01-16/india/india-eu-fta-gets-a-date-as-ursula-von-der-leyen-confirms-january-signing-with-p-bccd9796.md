## Full Article
A major shift is underway in global trade, and India is shaping it on its own terms. The EU has confirmed that its upcoming free trade agreement with India will exclude agriculture, respecting New Delhi’s firm stance on protecting farmers and food security. The deal, set to be the EU’s largest ever, marks a strategic partnership rather than a political compromise. While Europe gains access to one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, India safeguards its most sensitive sector. Limited concessions on wine and spirits show balance without surrender. As geopolitical equations change, this agreement signals a confident India — willing to engage globally, but unwilling to sacrifice social stability at home.
