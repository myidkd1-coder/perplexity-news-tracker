Today, the Honourable Anita Anand, Minister of Foreign Affairs, celebrated the launch of the new Canada-India Talent and Innovation Strategy, including the signing of 13 new partnerships, during her visit to Mumbai, India.

Launched today by Universities Canada and Colleges and Institutes Canada, this strategy represents over twenty of Canada’s top institutions, deepens cooperation with India and strengthens the people-to-people ties that continue to anchor the bilateral relationship. India is central to Canada’s Indo‑Pacific Strategy, and education and research partnerships with that country create innovation ties and long‑term cooperation.

Minister Anand welcomed the new strategy, which will facilitate research, student exchanges, hybrid campuses, and AI centres of excellence between Canada and India. We have vast human capital, with students and faculty already deeply connected on cutting-edge research. This agreement will reinforce collaboration through opportunities for students and researchers, drive economic growth and deepen the strong people-to-people ties that connect our two countries.

The strategy is based on four key pillars: embedding Canadian capability in India’s priority sectors, translating knowledge and talent into economic outcome, rebalancing and deepening the talent relationship and demonstrating credibility through speed and delivery.

During a recent visit to India, the Honourable Evan Solomon, Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Innovation witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the University of Waterloo and India-based Tata Consultancy Services. This reflected the broad trend toward deepening academic and commercial ties between the two countries, accelerating skills development and business expansion between Canada and India.
