Business news 12 December 2025

The UK Economy unexpectedly contracted in the three months to October, according to official figures released Friday. It follows a 0.1% expansion over the three months to September. Economists had expected 0% growth over the period. The Office for Statistics noted that services output stalled, construction output fell 0.3% and production output fell 0.5% “largely because of a fall in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers in this period.”

SME, Tax & Credit Risk

Chancellor’s tax U-turn branded a “glaring error”

Dame Meg Hillier has criticised the Chancellor’s handling of income tax plans, warning that mixed signals ahead of the Budget left businesses “confused or annoyed.”

Why it matters: Policy uncertainty makes it harder for SMEs to plan pricing, margins and credit terms with confidence.

Tax rises threaten jobs and growth, warns CBI

The CBI says early-2025 momentum has faded, blaming high taxes, energy costs and a complex tax regime for stalling investment.

Why it matters: Slower growth and squeezed margins increase late-payment risk across supply chains.

Investors brace for £144bn capital gains tax hit

Treasury forecasts suggest a surge in CGT receipts as investors and second-home owners sell assets.

Why it matters: Asset sell-offs often signal caution, reducing liquidity and increasing payment delays for suppliers.

Economy

UK economy unexpectedly contracts

The UK economy shrank in the three months to October, following modest growth previously. Services stalled, construction fell 0.3% and production dropped 0.5%, driven by weaker vehicle manufacturing.

Why it matters: A contracting economy raises insolvency risk among customers, making credit checks and monitoring essential.

Bank brands Budget “monumentally mishandled”

London-listed lender S&U said recent Budget measures have dampened consumer confidence and failed to drive growth.

Why it matters: Weaker confidence can quickly translate into slower payments and higher bad-debt exposure.

Leisure & Hospitality

Pub industry pleads for urgent tax relief

Industry leaders warn higher business rates could trigger 15,000 job losses and widespread closures.

Why it matters: Hospitality suppliers face elevated credit risk as venues struggle with rising fixed costs.

Chancellor’s business rates claim questioned

UKHospitality says pub rates could rise by 15%, far higher than initially suggested by the Treasury.

Why it matters: Unexpected cost increases often lead to stretched payment terms or non-payment.

Financial Services

FCA plans targeted support for 18m savers

The FCA will allow consumers to access tailored investment guidance without full financial assessments.

Why it matters: Improved financial decision-making may support longer-term stability, but short-term risks remain.

Corporate & HMRC

Auditor queried source of funds at Gupta-owned firm

MHA resigned as auditor of a Liberty Steel Group company after concerns over intercompany transactions.

Why it matters: Weak governance is a warning sign for suppliers offering credit.

HMRC whistleblower rewards not a “guaranteed win”

A new scheme aims to recover unpaid tax but carries risks for informants and uncertain outcomes.

Why it matters: Aggressive tax enforcement can push already-stretched businesses into distress.

Retail

Brits set for festive spending boost

Consumers are expected to spend £24.6bn this Christmas, up 3.5% year-on-year.

Why it matters: Seasonal sales help cashflow, but credit exposure rises sharply if customers over-extend.

Market snapshot

UK economic growth has slipped into contraction, undermining confidence. Equity markets remain fragile as investors weigh weaker growth against higher tax expectations. Sterling is under pressure against both the dollar and the euro as growth forecasts soften. Overall sentiment remains cautious, with businesses and investors looking for clearer policy direction.
