Santa might not have left a playoff appearance under the Cowboys' or Commanders' Christmas tree this year, but the two teams got the gift of playing in front of a national TV audience on a holiday.

The NFC East rivals faced off on Thursday in Landover, Md. The Cowboys saw their playoff hopes come to an end last week, with the Eagles securing back-to-back NFC East titles. The Commanders' season, meanwhile, took another miserable turn last week with Marcus Mariota going down with an injury.
