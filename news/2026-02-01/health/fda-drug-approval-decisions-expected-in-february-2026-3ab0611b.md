## Summary
The FDA has several key drug approval decisions scheduled for February 2026, including clemidsogene lanparvovec for Mucopolysaccharidosis II and pembrolizumab regimen for platinum-sensitive endometrial cancer.

## Full Article
The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date refers to the deadline set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reviewing a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) and making a final decision on marketing approval. The typical period for review is 10 months after the drug application has been accepted by the Agency. For drugs that have Priority Review, the review period is reduced to 6 months from the time of application acceptance.

Clemidsogene lanparvovec for Mucopolysaccharidosis II

PDUFA Date: February 8, 2026

The FDA is expected to decide on whether to approve the first gene therapy for mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome. MPS II is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in lysosomal iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme leading to glycosaminoglycan accumulation and organ dysfunction.

Clemidsogene lanparvovec is a one-time adeno-associated virus therapy that delivers the iduronate-2-sulfatase gene directly to the central nervous system. The application is supported by positive biomarker data from the CAMPSIITE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03566043), which evaluated the gene therapy in children aged 4 months to 5 years old with MPS II, as well as 12-month clinical data.

At 1 year, results showed an 82% reduction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of heparin sulfate (HS) D2S6, a key biomarker of MPS II. Among the 13 study participants, continued skill acquisition or stability was observed through 1 year. These results were consistent with those observed in the pivotal 16-week trial suggesting that CSF HS D2S6 will likely predict clinical benefit in these patients.

Pembrolizumab Regimen for Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer

PDUFA Date: February 20, 2026

The FDA is reviewing a pembrolizumab-based regimen for the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy, is currently approved under the brand name Keytruda® for other gynecological cancers, including cervical cancer and endometrial carcinoma.

In the randomized, double-blind KEYNOTE-B96 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05116189), study participants with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer (N=643) were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab, or placebo plus paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).

Findings from the first interim analysis (median follow-up: 15.6 months) showed pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 30%, regardless of PD-L1 status, compared with placebo plus chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab (hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.58-0.84]; P <.0001). The 12-month PFS rate was 33.1% (95% CI, 27.7-38.5) vs 21.3% (95% CI, 16.6-26.4), respectively.

At the second interim analysis (median follow-up: 26.6 months), a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) was observed with the pembrolizumab regimen vs placebo plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.94]; P = .0053). The 18-month OS rates were 51.5% and 38.9%, respectively.

Milsaperidone for Acute Bipolar I Disorder and Schizophrenia

PDUFA Date: February 21, 2026

The NDA for milsaperidone is currently under review for the treatment of acute bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia. Milsaperidone is the active metabolite of iloperidone, an atypical antipsychotic currently approved under the brand name Fanapt®.

Following oral administration, milsaperidone rapidly converts to iloperidone and has been shown to be bioequivalent to iloperidone at both low and high doses. The NDA is also supported by iloperidone clinical trial data.

In patients with schizophrenia, iloperidone significantly improved symptoms, as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score, and extended the time to relapse or impending relapse vs placebo. In patients with bipolar I disorder, iloperidone led to greater improvements in symptoms based on the Young Mania Rating Scale.

Dupilumab for Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis

PDUFA Date: February 28, 2026

The FDA has granted Priority Review to the supplemental BLA for dupilumab for the treatment of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), a subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis, in adults and children aged 6 years and older. AFRS is a chronic type 2 inflammatory disease of the sinuses characterized by fungal hypersensitivity.

The application is supported by data from the phase 3 LIBERTY-AFRS-AIMS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04684524), in which 62 patients with AFRS were randomly assigned to receive an age- and weight-based dose of dupilumab every 2 weeks or 4 weeks (n=33) or placebo (n=29).

Findings at 52-weeks showed sinus opacification scores (a measure of nasal congestion as assessed by computed tomography scans) improved by 50% in patients treated with dupilumab vs 9.8% for those who received placebo (primary endpoint; P <.0001).

Compared with placebo, dupilumab led to significant improvements in patient-reported nasal congestion/obstruction (P <.0001) and greater reductions in nasal polyp size (P <.0001) at week 52. The dupilumab group was also less likely to need systemic corticosteroids and/or surgery vs placebo (29.1% fewer proportion of patients; P =.0010).

If approved, dupilumab would be the first medication indicated for AFRS.

Idebenone for Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy

PDUFA Date: February 28, 2026

The NDA for idebenone, a novel short-chain benzoquinone, is being reviewed for the treatment of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). This inherited mitochondrial disorder damages retinal ganglion cells, resulting in rapid vision loss. Idebenone is expected to restore mitochondrial function and reactivate retinal ganglion cell function.

The application is supported by safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 RHODOS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00747487), which compared the efficacy of idebenone vs placebo in 85 participants, and the open-label phase 4 LEROS study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02774005), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of long-term idebenone treatment in 199 patients.

Findings from these trials showed treatment with idebenone led to clinically meaningful improvements in visual acuity among patients with LHON, with long-term data suggesting clinically relevant benefit (defined as clinically relevant recovery or stabilization of visual acuity from baseline) at 12 months.
