## Full Article
Trump calls it a bold new path to peace. India calls for a closer look. As the US President rolls out his “Board of Peace” with much fanfare, India’s decision to stay away reflects deep strategic caution. The board’s composition, including Pakistan and key Middle Eastern players but excluding Europe, China and Russia, raises doubts about its global weight. With no institutional backing and a lifespan tied to Trump’s presidency, India is wary of investing diplomatic capital in a platform that could quickly unravel. New Delhi’s pause underscores its long-held commitment to multilateralism, the UN framework, and strategic autonomy—especially when regional sensitivities and Pakistan’s presence complicate the picture.
