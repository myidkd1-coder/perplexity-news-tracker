NASA’s live coverage is underway on NASA+, Amazon Prime, and the agency’s YouTube channel for the return of the agency’s SpaceX Crew-11 mission.

On Jan. 8, NASA decided to return Crew-11 earlier than originally planned as teams monitored a medical concern with a crew member currently living and working aboard the International Space Station. The crew member is stable.

NASA astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov will close the hatch at approximately 3:30 p.m. EST between the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and the orbital complex.

NASA will provide live undocking coverage at 4:45 p.m. on NASA+, Amazon Prime, and the agency’s YouTube channel. The spacecraft will autonomously undock from the space station within a one-hour window which begins at after 5 p.m. for its return to Earth..

NASA and SpaceX are targeting splashdown at approximately 3:41 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 15, off the coast of California. NASA will provide coverage of deorbit burn, entry, and splashdown beginning at 2:15 a.m. on NASA+, Amazon Prime, and the agency’s YouTube channel.

As part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the Crew-11 mission will return to Earth after completing a long-duration science mission aboard the space station. Cardman, Fincke, Yui, and Platonov launched on Aug. 1, 2025, and docked to the space station a day later. It was Fincke’s fourth spaceflight, Yui’s second, and the first for Cardman and Platonov.
