Spain Approves Historic Decree to Regularise Up to 500,000 Undocumented Migrants

Spain’s cabinet used a Royal Decree on 27 January 2026 to launch an extraordinary regularisation that could grant residence and work permits to roughly 500,000 undocumented migrants already in the country. Applicants must show at least five months’ presence before 31 December 2025 and have no criminal record. The measure, welcomed by business groups but criticised by the opposition, will give employers access to new legal talent and expand Spain’s formal labour pool.
