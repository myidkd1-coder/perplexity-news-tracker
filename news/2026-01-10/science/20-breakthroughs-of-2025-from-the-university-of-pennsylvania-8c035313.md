## Full Article
A look back at 20 of the innovative breakthroughs happening at Penn in 2025 offers a glimpse of research that spans boundaries, forging novel connections to advance knowledge, improve lives, and address the greatest challenges of the time, including climate, health, and data.

It's not just what is done, but how it is done.

As Penn researchers lean into collaborations that cross disciplines and boundaries, recognizing that the more ideas and people from all backgrounds are at the table, the more rigorous and creative the discoveries will be. In laboratories, clinics, libraries, and at field sites, Penn researchers had breakthroughs across a range of disciplines, discovering ancient tombs, treating the world’s first patient with personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy, and developing cleaner, greener concrete. These stories are a snapshot of the vibrant, innovative research at Penn.

A 3,600-year-old tomb from the lost Abydos dynasty unearthed

In a historic breakthrough, a child diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder was successfully treated with a customized CRISPR gene editing therapy by a team at the Perelman School of Medicine (Penn Medicine) and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

Advancing lifesaving and more cost-effective weather predictions

Mechanical engineering and applied mechanics professor Paris Perdikaris and collaborators developed Aurora, a machine-learning model that has predictive capabilities for air quality, ocean waves, tropical cyclone tracks, and weather.

Exposure to air pollution accelerates Alzheimer’s disease

Research from Penn Medicine finds living in areas with a high concentration of air pollution is associated with an increased buildup of amyloid and tau proteins in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients, worsening cognitive decline.

Understanding choice: Neuroscience and history

Emily Falk’s “What We Value: The Neuroscience of Choice & Change” describes the brain’s value and self‑relevance systems in everyday decisions, while Sophia Rosenfeld’s “The Age of Choice: A History of Freedom in Modern Life” charts how modern freedom became equated with choosing—together reshaping how we see agency and limits.

Armoring CAR T cells to prevent self-sabotage and better fight cancer

An interdisciplinary team of Penn researchers uncovered how solid tumors communicate with engineered cancer-fighting cells, causing them to commit fratricide and inhibit treatment, pointing toward improved therapies for treating cancers.

A key brain circuit in the fight against cocaine use disorder

Research led by Heath Schmidt of the School of Nursing has identified a brain circuit that plays a critical role in regulating cocaine-seeking behavior, paving the way for the development of more effective therapies to treat addiction.

A built-in ‘off switch’ to stop persistent pain

Seeking the neural basis of long‑lasting pain, biologist J. Nicholas Betley in the School of Arts & Sciences led a collaborative team that identified a critical brainstem hub that can halt incoming pain signals before they spread across the brain. Their findings suggest new ways to interrupt chronic pain at its source.

Future mRNA vaccines may prevent food and seasonal allergies

Early research from Penn Medicine finds a new mRNA vaccine stops allergens from causing immune reactions and life-threatening inflammation, with promise for future treatment for a variety of seasonal and food allergies.

The world’s smallest programmable, autonomous robots

Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Science have developed the world’s smallest fully programmable, autonomous robots. These microrobots, each smaller than a grain of salt, could drive advancements in medicine and manufacturing.

Deepfakes, digital doubles, and the law

As artificial intelligence continues to make it simpler to produce digital replicas of real people—deepfakes, voice clones, and other once-unthinkable products, Penn Carey Law’s Jennifer Rothman argues for guardrails that preserve individuals’ control over their voices and likenesses.

Researchers crack the code of body’s ancient immune defense

A collaborative team from Penn Medicine and Penn Engineering has unraveled the mathematics of a 500-million-year-old protein network that “decides” which foreign materials are friend or foe.

Antiviral chewing gum to reduce influenza and herpes transmission

Using a clinical-grade antiviral gum, researchers at Penn Dental Medicine and collaborators reduced viral loads of influenza and herpes by over 95% in experimental models, offering a safe, FDA-compliant approach to curb virus spread and potentially prevent infections.

Designing cleaner, greener concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide

Using graphic statics, a method where forces are mapped as lines, they design forms that balance compression and tension. These result in structures that use far fewer materials while remaining strong and efficient. (Image: Eric Sucar)

Penn engineers, materials scientists, and designers have developed a 3D-printed concrete solution based on diatomaceous earth that has enhanced carbon capture, is stronger, and uses fewer materials like cement.

Wild birds drive the U.S. bird flu outbreak

Penn Vet’s Louise Moncla has traced H5N1 viruses in North America to better understand the role wild birds play in the current bird flu outbreak.

Hydralazine, a blood pressure drug, may also prove useful in treating glioblastoma

A Penn-led team has revealed a how hydralazine, one of the world’s oldest blood pressure drugs and a mainstay treatment for preeclampsia, works at the molecular level. In doing so, they made a surprising discovery—it can also halt the growth of aggressive brain tumors.

Looking to the past to understand the impacts of human land use in South Asia

An international group of scholars, including Penn archaeologists, produced the first large-scale synthesis of archaeological evidence of land use in South Asia from 12,000 and 6,000 years ago. Looking at the ancient practices of deforestation and urbanization, the data they collected improves the quality of current climate models.

High‑speed rail boosts EV adoption

Economist Hanming Fang’s study ties China’s high-speed rail expansion to alleviating range anxiety and significantly increasing electric vehicle sales and market share, with implications for urban growth and charging networks.

Second infection in kids doubles long COVID risk

Across roughly 407,000 pediatric patients, a second SARS‑CoV‑2 infection was linked to twice the long‑COVID rate and higher risks for myocarditis, clots, and renal and cognitive issues, according to research at Penn Medicine.

AI finds hundreds of potential antiobiotics in snake and spider venom

Using the APEX deep‑learning system, researchers led by César de la Fuente sifted through a database of more than 40 million venom-encrypted peptides, tiny proteins evolved by snakes and spiders, surfacing hundreds of potential antibiotics.
