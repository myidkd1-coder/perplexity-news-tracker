India Battles Dense Winter Fog in December 2025 Bringing Air Travel Delays, Flight Cancellations, and Traffic Disruptions Across Northern States

India is facing significant challenges this December 2025 as dense fog blankets northern states, severely disrupting air travel and causing widespread traffic congestion. The thick fog, particularly in Delhi and surrounding regions, has led to numerous flight cancellations, delays, and diversions, leaving passengers stranded and airports overwhelmed. Reduced visibility has also made road travel hazardous, with commuters struggling to navigate through fog-covered streets. These weather conditions, compounded by low temperatures and smog, have forced authorities to issue alerts, urging people to exercise caution and stay updated on potential delays and disruptions.

Dense Fog Disrupts Northern India, Affects Air Travel and Road Traffic

On December 16, 2025, dense fog continued to cause significant disruption across several northern Indian states, with Delhi waking up to a thick blanket of fog that sharply reduced visibility, leading to widespread air travel delays and road traffic congestion. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued warnings of persistent overcast skies and smoggy conditions that were expected to continue throughout the day.

At the heart of the disruptions was Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, which issued a fog advisory early in the morning. Travelers were alerted to possible delays and cancellations, as the fog had a substantial impact on flight schedules. The airport’s social media updates confirmed that flight operations were recovering gradually but cautioned that some flights might still face disruptions, especially for arrivals and departures. Passengers were advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport to avoid unnecessary inconveniences. To manage the situation, the airport deployed additional ground staff across terminals to assist affected travelers.

The impact of the dense fog was most severe the previous day, on December 15, when thick fog blanketed the National Capital Region, leading to mass flight cancellations and delays. Over 300 flights were grounded across northern India, with many more facing delays due to low visibility. In Delhi alone, 228 flights were cancelled, including 131 departures and 97 arrivals, out of the usual 1,360 daily flights. The thick fog also forced several flights to be diverted to nearby airports, exacerbating the situation further.

Airlines responded promptly to the situation by issuing travel advisories and updating passengers on the ongoing disruptions. National carrier Air India acknowledged the chaos caused by the dense fog over Delhi and northern India. The airline cited congestion, limited parking bays, and significant disruptions to its flight schedules. To mitigate passenger inconvenience, Air India offered assistance, including options for rebookings or full refunds in cases of cancellations. The airline also activated its “Fog Care” program, which allowed affected passengers to reschedule flights or receive full refunds without facing penalties.

Low-cost carrier IndiGo also issued a warning to passengers, advising them of potential delays, particularly during the early morning hours when fog tends to disrupt air traffic across northern India. IndiGo urged passengers to stay updated with flight statuses to avoid unnecessary travel to the airport if their flights were delayed. Similarly, SpiceJet, another low-cost airline, advised travelers about possible delays, especially at airports affected by the fog.

The IMD’s weather forecast for December 16 included warnings of dense to very dense fog in the early morning hours across multiple states, including Delhi-NCR, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, and parts of the Northeast. The IMD also forecast light rain or snowfall at isolated locations over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand in the coming days. The agency predicted thunderstorms with lightning in isolated spots across Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal between December 16 and 17, as well as gusty winds of 30-40 km/h that could affect the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Temperatures in northwest India were expected to dip by around two degrees Celsius within the next 24 hours, while temperatures across other regions, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, central India, and northeastern states, were predicted to remain unchanged.

In response to these weather conditions, the IMD strongly advised commuters to exercise caution during foggy conditions. The department recommended driving at reduced speeds, using fog lights or low-beam headlights, and maintaining a safe distance between vehicles. Additionally, travelers were urged to avoid unnecessary journeys during peak fog hours and to stay updated with official weather and traffic advisories to ensure their safety.

India is grappling with severe fog disruptions this December 2025, causing widespread flight cancellations, delays, and hazardous road conditions across northern states. The thick fog, especially in Delhi, has left travelers stranded and affected daily life.

While fog-related disruptions are common during the winter months in northern India, the widespread impact on both air travel and road traffic underscores the significant challenges posed by this seasonal weather phenomenon. As northern India continues to grapple with reduced visibility and fluctuating temperatures, authorities and travelers alike are urged to stay vigilant and prepared for potential disruptions in the coming days.
