With a busy time for sports and the awards season picking up ahead of the Oscars, February’s most-discussed TV releases are dominated by awards ceremonies, sports events, and a few brand-new series. In partnership with predictive media analytics company Diesel Labs, ScreenRant has exclusive data revealing TV titles generating the greatest chatter before their premieres. The releases are each given a hype score, measured by online engagement.

The month’s TV shows, specials, and broadcasts are ranked by Attention Signals, which are calculated through measures such as likes, shares, comments, and views on social and video channels like Facebook and YouTube. With this data, we’re able to glean valuable insight into which TV releases are making the biggest impact on prospective viewers before hitting the small screen.

The attention scale metric is the percentage of attention based on the show or movie in the number one spot (which is represented as 100%).

Excluding the returns of established series like The Lincoln Lawyer season 4, Cross season 2, or Dark Winds season 4, February is packed with some brand-new titles and events that are expected to yield substantial viewership numbers. Beyond the Super Bowl and Grammys, some of the much-discussed new TV series include intriguing cult classic remakes and documentaries. Per the data revealed by Diesel Labs to ScreenRant, February 2026’s most anticipated TV slate largely celebrates sports, music, and film on the big stage.

According to Diesel Labs, the most anticipated TV release of February 2026 is the 68th Grammy Awards, with the music industry ceremony airing live on CBS on February 1. Among the most-nominated artists at the 2026 Grammys are Kendrick Lamar, Jack Antonoff, Lady Gaga, Sabrina Carpenter, and Bad Bunny. The second-most discussed TV event of the month is the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, which will see 24 of the NBA's star players compete over the three-day event.

These events are followed close behind in anticipation by the NFL's Super Bowl LX, which will see the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots on February 8, with Bad Bunny performing at the half-time show. Also among February 2026's most-discussed ceremonies and events on the small screen are the 79th BAFTA Film Awards, the start of the 2026 Winter Olympics, and the 57th NAACP Image Awards.

February also brings some new TV shows that have been driving significant online engagement ahead of their premieres. These titles include Peacock's The 'Burbs, the Keke Palmer-led remake of Tom Hanks' 1989 cult classic movie, Disney+'s new docuseries We Call It Imagineering, and Prime Video's James Wan-produced thriller adaptation 56 Days. Closing out the top 10 most anticipated TV drops of February 2026 is Puppy Bowl XXII, Animal Planet's annual puppy alternative on Super Bowl Sunday.

While there are plenty of brand-new TV series coming in February 2026 that didn't make the top 10 titles, such as CIA, Portobello, and the Scrubs revival, the data reveals that prospective viewers have been talking about the month's biggest awards shows and sporting events far more.
