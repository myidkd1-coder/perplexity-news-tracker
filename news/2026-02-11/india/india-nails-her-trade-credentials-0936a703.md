The report continues, “It signals a steady, confidence driven approach to long term growth and fiscal governance.”

The budget aims to keep India on course to becoming a US$5trn economy – a target that the government once asserted would be hit by 2025, but according to widespread interpretations of the October 2025 World Economic Outlook2 now looks more likely to be reached by 2028–29.3
