India Poised for Global Trade Surge in 2026 on Back of FTAs and Resilience

India's international trade navigated a tumultuous 2025, marked by high tariffs, supply chain snags, and currency volatility. Despite these significant global challenges, the nation's export sector displayed surprising resilience. Data indicates that damage to external trade was limited, setting the stage for a potentially brighter outlook in 2026, fueled by strategic Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and domestic policy initiatives.

The United States' imposition of steep tariffs and disruptions originating from China posed considerable hurdles. Additionally, India faced secondary tariffs for sourcing oil from Russia, and the Indian Rupee experienced notable depreciation against the US dollar. However, these headwinds did not derail India's export momentum entirely, showcasing an underlying strength in its trade ecosystem.

Navigating 2025 Headwinds

The year 2025 presented a complex global trade environment. The US, India's largest trade partner, imposed substantial tariffs, directly impacting export volumes. Critical mineral supplies were disrupted due to issues with China, a major import source. Russia's role in India's energy security also led to geopolitical pricing pressures and secondary tariffs from the US. These factors, coupled with a weakening Rupee, created a challenging landscape for Indian businesses engaged in international commerce.

Resilient Export Performance in FY26

Despite the adverse conditions, preliminary data for the financial year 2025-26 (April-November) reveals a cumulative merchandise export value increase of 2.62% to $292.07 billion. Notably, non-petroleum exports grew by 5.86% to $254.08 billion, highlighting the diversification and robustness of India's manufacturing and service sectors. Services exports also continued their upward trajectory, contributing to a total export figure (merchandise and services) of $562.13 billion, a 5.43% rise year-on-year. This sustained performance underscores India's capacity to absorb external shocks.

Official Statements and Responses

Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal acknowledged the challenging environment, stating, 'despite persistent global uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical challenges, India has maintained a strong and resilient export performance.' Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), offered a more measured perspective, projecting total exports to reach approximately $850 billion in FY26, falling short of the ambitious $1 trillion target due to a slowing global economy and protectionist trends. However, he noted that the worst might be over for India's exports.

The Promise of 2026 and FY27

Looking ahead, 2026 and the fiscal year 2027 appear significantly more promising. Ajay Sahai, Director General and CEO of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), expressed optimism, stating, 'We feel the worst for India’s exports is over. We are all set to improve from here.' This positive sentiment is largely attributed to the groundwork laid in 2025, particularly the finalization of several key Free Trade Agreements.

India has recently concluded FTAs with Mauritius, the United Arab Emirates, EFTA countries, Indo-Pacific Economic Framework members, the United Kingdom, Oman, and New Zealand. Three of these—with the UK, Oman, and New Zealand—were signed in 2025. These agreements promise substantial benefits, including duty-free access for 98-100% of Indian goods exports to these markets, significantly boosting trade growth potential in FY27.

Expanding Trade Horizons

Further strengthening India's global trade position, discussions for potential FTAs are underway or being contemplated with major economies like the United States, the European Union, Russia, and Mexico. If successful, these agreements would position India with trade pacts covering almost every significant global economy, excluding China. The EU and US markets, in particular, represent substantial opportunities for Indian exports.

Domestic Catalysts: PLI and Diversification

The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme is already acting as a significant export booster, particularly for sectors such as electricals, electronics, machinery, automobiles, and auto components. While the impact in pharmaceuticals is expected to materialize over the next 2-3 years, the scheme is driving substantial investment. The Commerce Ministry is also focusing on diversifying India's export basket with technological depth across electronics, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, IT services, petroleum products, agriculture, and processed foods for growth in 2026.

Execution Over Agreements

While the conclusion of FTAs is a positive step, Ajay Srivastava of GTRI emphasizes the critical need for effective implementation. He advises that India must urgently review the performance of existing FTAs sector-by-sector to ensure they translate into measurable trade gains and integrate Indian firms into global value chains. Srivastava stresses that in 2026, India's export success will hinge less on external opportunities and more on domestic execution—upgrading product quality, moving up the value chain, lowering costs, and optimizing the use of trade agreements. Simplifying regulations and improving the ease of doing business remain paramount.

Impact

This news indicates a positive trajectory for the Indian economy, particularly for sectors heavily involved in international trade. The strengthening export performance and the strategic benefits from FTAs could lead to increased corporate revenues, potential job creation, and improved foreign exchange reserves. This boosts investor confidence in export-oriented industries and the broader Indian market.
