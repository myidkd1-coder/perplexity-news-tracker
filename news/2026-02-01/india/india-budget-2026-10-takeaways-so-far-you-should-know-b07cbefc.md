## Full Article
Capital expenditure for FY 2026-27 was increased by about 9% to Rs12.2 lakh crore, reinforcing the government’s infrastructure-led growth strategy. Public capex has risen sharply from Rs 2 lakh crore in 2014-15, reflecting sustained focus on asset creation.

A Bio Pharma Shakti programme was launched with an allocation of Rs 10,000 crore (Rs100 billion) over five years to position India as a global hub for biopharma and biosimilars, strengthening domestic capabilities in high-value healthcare manufacturing.

Manufacturing received strong emphasis, particularly in seven strategic and frontier sectors. The government also announced support for rare earth corridors in Odisha, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu to reduce import dependence and secure critical mineral supply chains.

The Economic Survey projects GDP growth of 6.8–7.2% for 2026-27, while average inflation between April and December 2025 stood at 1.7%, the lowest since the CPI series began.
