Short-Term Acute Care Hospitals: Staff End Users Can Now Access PEPPERs

If you’re a staff end user (SEU), you can now access Program for Evaluating Payment Patterns Electronic Reports (PEPPERs) through the Identity & Access Management System (I&A). Contact your authorized official (AO) or access manager (AM) and ask them to grant you access.

AOs and AMs – See step-by-step instructions in the I&A System Quick Reference Guide that explain how to:

Invite and approve an SEU

Laboratories: Paper Fee Coupons & CLIA Certificates Ending March 1

CMS is improving the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program by switching to electronic fee coupons and CLIA certificates. After March 1, 2026, paper fee coupons and CLIA certificates will no longer be available; we’ll stop mailing paper versions after this date. In addition, you must pay your CLIA certification and survey fees online; checks will no longer be accepted.

This is the last chance for eligible laboratories and providers that perform laboratory testing to sign up for CMS email notifications to receive electronic CLIA fee coupons and certificates. Failure to switch may result in billing and certification issues.

You can switch to electronic notifications from CMS or update your email address by:

Emailing your state agency (PDF)

Contacting your Accreditation Organization if you’re an accredited laboratory

Note: This doesn’t apply to CLIA-exempt states.

Global Surgery: Accurately Report Postoperative Visits

In a report, the Office of Inspector General found that although practitioners aren’t required to provide Medicare patients the number of postoperative visits that CMS considered in valuing the global surgery fee, overall, fewer visits are provided than are considered in the valuation.

Practitioners must report post-operative evaluation and management visits if they practice in a group of 10 or more practitioners in 1 of these 9 states: Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, and Rhode Island. You’re exempt from required reporting if your practice has less than 10 practitioners, but we encourage you to report if possible.

See the Global Surgery (PDF) booklet for information on how to report postoperative visits in inpatient and outpatient settings.

Optometry Services at Nursing Facilities: Bill Correctly

In a report, the Office of Inspector General found that Medicare improperly paid optometrists for high-level evaluation and management (E/M) services at nursing facilities. These E/M services aren’t usually billed by optometrists and don’t meet Medicare requirements.

Optometrists visit nursing facilities to provide services like:

Eye exams for residents with diabetes and those at high risk for glaucoma

Diagnostic tests and treatment for residents with age-related macular degeneration

During the audit, OIG determined that claims didn’t meet the E/M service criteria for moderate to high complexity level subsequent nursing facility care.
