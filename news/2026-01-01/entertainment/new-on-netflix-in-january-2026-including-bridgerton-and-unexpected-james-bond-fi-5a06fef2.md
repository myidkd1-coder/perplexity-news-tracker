Netflix is kicking off 2026 with a bang, thanks to the return of one of its most successful shows – and the addition of one of cinema’s most bankable franchises.

This month will see the streamer bounce back from two huge removals by releasing part one of Bridgerton’s fourth season, starring Luke Thompson and Yerin Ha in the lead roles.

There’ll also be a new crime thriller from Joe Carnahan starring real-life friends Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, and rock climber Alex Honnold, the subject of documentary Free Solo, will free climb Tapei 101, one of the planet's tallest skyscrapers, in a live special set to air through the night in the UK.

But in perhaps the streamer’s biggest moment in January, every single James Bond film will become available on Netflix for the first time. Their addition arrives following a licensing deal with Amazon MGM Studios, who owns the rights.

Find the full list of every new release arriving on Netflix in January 2026 below – and a rundown of everything being removed here.
