Lenovo Tech World LIVE and taking a break (Image credit: Lenovo/Tom's Guide) As a reminder, we're tracking all of Lenovo's big announcements during Lenovo Tech World right here. Head on over to see what Lenovo and AMD have to say. Meanwhile, we're taking a break on this blog until tomorrow. Check back in with us for more tech and gadgets as we explore Las Vegas and the various exhibition halls.

Lenovo's keynote kicks off soon (Image credit: Future) Lenovo's massive keynote taking place in The Sphere at CES 2026 is kicking off soon. We'll be tracking all of the announcements in a separate article, which we'll share once it's live.

Riding the 'Rolls-Royce' of electric scooters (Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide) Forget Bird and Lime, the Navee UT5 Ultra X is inspired by supercars, specifically the Rolls-Royce Phantom. Does it ride as smooth and lux as a Phantom? Read the hands-on experience from my colleague Dan Bracaglia to find out.

Keep your home secure with smart locks (Image credit: Desloc) CES can seem like a show off flash with giant TVs, dancing robots, and very, very silly tech. But there are plenty of practical devices to check out as well. For example, this year, smart lock companies are introducing new models with longer-lasting rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Plus, more integration of the Matter standard for newer and smarter facial recognition. Here are the best smart locks we've seen at CES 2026.

We tried the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chip and it kicks (Image credit: Future) Yesterday, Intel revealed its new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs. Today, my colleague Darragh Murphy got a chance to see the Series 3 in action. He tried a variety of recent titles like Battlefield 6 on upcoming gaming laptops. "One thing's for sure: your next gaming laptop may not need a dedicated GPU after all," he said. Keep an eye out for a new gaming laptop with an Intel Core Ultra X9 or X7 processor to try it yourself this year.

Smart rings take over CES as AI moves beyond pins and glasses (Image credit: Sandbar) If early buzz at CES is any indication, 2026 is shaping up to be the Year of the Smart Ring. After a rocky run for AI pins and glasses, the industry appears to be converging on rings as the most natural, low-friction way to interact with ambient intelligence. Much of that momentum started late last year with Sandbar’s Stream Ring, which positioned the ring not just as a health tracker but as an AI extension. Now, a wave of newcomers — including Vocci, Index 01 and Aivela — are following, aiming to push rings beyond biometrics and into productivity and AI interaction. Brands like Oura and RingConn helped normalize wearing tech on your finger, but this next generation is trying to make the ring an active input device, and going beyond just a passive sensor. At CES, the broader shift is clear: smart rings are evolving from wellness accessories into conversational interfaces — and may finally offer a form factor people actually want to use every day.

Amazon brings Alexa+ to Samsung TVs, BMW vehicles and Oura wearables Today at CES, Amazon announced a major expansion of Alexa+, extending the AI assistant well beyond Echo devices and deeper into TVs, cars, appliances and wearables. Samsung will be the first third-party brand to build Alexa+ directly into its smart TVs, letting users search for content, control smart home devices and manage routines without an Echo. In cars, BMW is debuting a next-gen in-vehicle Alexa+ experience in the iX3, enabling more natural, conversational voice control for navigation, media and vehicle functions. Amazon also highlighted new partnerships with Bosch and Oura. Bosch coffee machines will respond to voice commands for personalized brewing, while Oura integration will let users check sleep, recovery and wellness insights through Alexa+. Together, the updates signal Amazon’s push to make Alexa+ an always-available, ambient assistant across everyday devices — at home, in the car and beyond.

The 7 best TVs we've seen at CES so far (Image credit: Tom's Guide) CES is well underway and we've had time to check out a ton of TVs from all of the major manufacturers this week. It means we've seen tons of televisions, but a few have stuck out. We picked 7 of the best TVs we've seen at CES 2026 that you need to know about. We've got options from Samsung, LG, Hisense and more with features like new OLED panels, lifestyle framing and reimagined mini-LEDs.

Falling back in love with the Asus TUF Gaming A14 laptop (Image credit: Future) Asus swapped out an Nvidia GPU for an AMD Strix Halo one, which could bring us back to the Asus TUF Gaming A14 after last year's price increase and poorer power efficiency. The 2026 edition also appears to feature a new AMD Ryzen AI Max+ chips. Its capable of 60 teraflops of RDNA 3.5 GPU performance, which is all integrated meaning better power efficiency. We'll be sure to test it out later this year, but for now we're quite curious.

Nvidia Q&A starting soon (Image credit: Future) Nvidia is holding a Q&A session with CEO Jensen Huang soon and the big man just came on stage. We'll see what we can get him tell us about Nvidia's future plans regarding GPUs, AI and more.

OLED Alienware, baby! @tomsguide ♬ BETA 777 - beaty Invading Earth with an OLED screen, finally! While the Alienware 16 Area-51 for 2026 might not be an astronomical upgrade, it has something many have asked for... an OLED display! The original Alienware 16 Area-51 was our favorite gaming laptop of 2025. But with the inclusion of a 240Hz OLED panel, lower latency, and improved cooling, it has a strong shot at being one of the best gaming laptops, full stop For more details, check out our hands-on preview of the Alienware Area-51 2026 edition.

Prevent stove fires when your fire alarm goes off (Image credit: Future) A lot of fires in the home start in the kitchen from stoves left on too long — so what if you could have a device that automatically shuts off the gas or power to your range? The FireAvert was created by a former firefighter to do just that. This device connects to your gas or electric line, and in the event a fire alarm goes off, it will stop the flow going to your stove. While the FireAvert has been around for a few years, this new model incorporates Z-Wave technology, making it "smart" for the first time, and letting you connect it to other smart home devices, and send you alerts on your phone. The FireAvert costs $249.

Cheap smartwatches can look good (Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide) My colleague, Dan Bracaglia, is our smartwatch guru and he just went hands-on with the Amazfit Active Max, a budget-friendly watch that still looks snazzy. It has a big screen and is brighter than the Apple Watch 11 with some serious battery life, while only costing $169!

A robot vacuum that can climb stairs!? @tomsguide ♬ Funny Song - Sounds Reel As Roomba falls apart, other robot vacuums are stepping in to fill the automated cleaning void. One of the more interesting ones we've seen is the Rororock Saros Rover that can climb stairs thanks to its two-wheel legs! This thing can also jump, what? We saw the Rover at CES and came away pretty impressed with the little AT-AT.

This is big for PC gaming! (Image credit: Nvidia) PC gaming is about to enter a new revolution with NVIDIA targeting 4K path-traced gaming at a whopping 240 FPS with DLSS 4.5. What is this technology? Essentially, Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is Nvidia’s AI-driven learning of how a game works and runs, and it makes it much better on your gaming desktop or laptop. As with any new technology, there’s much for us to test — we need to see what Super Resolution looks like and check out any potential latency issues in Dynamic Frame Generation, but it all sounds promising.

Klipsch is back! (Image credit: Klipsch) Klipsch has made an appearance at CES 2026 this year, and amongst its announcements of some very snazzy-looking amps and speakers, there's something very exciting indeed. Returning to the best headphone space, Klipsch has brought three pairs of cans to Las Vegas to give us an idea of what the future holds.

CES is for sleep (Image credit: XSmart / NeuroTx / Wis Medical / Ceragem) From smart mattresses to support teen development to sleep tracking lamps, the best sleep tech to come out of CES 2026 so far.

We tried Razer’s Project Motoko (Image credit: Razer) Razer’s Project Motoko is coming, and our own Anthony Spadafora tried it out. It's a bold concept that blends an AI-native computer into a high-end gaming headset. Powered by Snapdragon platforms and equipped with dual eye-level cameras, it offers a level of contextual awareness and processing power that smaller wearables simply can't match. Instead of needing to add some kind of additional AI wearable to your kit, Razer's uses the gaming headset you already have.

Bosch vacuums are packed with features (Image credit: Bosch) During CES 2026, popular appliance maker Bosch announced that it will bring its cordless cleaning tech to the U.S. for the first time. The company offers a 10-year motor warranty, which is something you won't find on most other vacuum cleaners. Even cooler, the vacuum comes with a dedicated sensor that changes color once your floor is fully cleaned, so you never need to guess whether the dust and other debris are lifted from the floor. For people who want to make sure their floors are really clean, this could be a game-changing feature.

Segway launches several new robot lawn mowers (Image credit: Segway) Segway, best known for its rideable devices, has made a major push into the robot lawn mower market. At CES, the company showed off eight different models, ranging from the cheapest Navimow i2 AWD to the Navimow X4 Series, which starts at $2,499. The company even showed off the Terranox Series that can cover areas as large as six acres, which is absurd for a robot lawn mower. It could be used for professional applications, such as golf courses and other large, grassy areas.

The best of CES day 2 round-up (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Before we get stuck into the third day of action from across CES 2026, let's take a look back at everything day 2 had to offer. We've got a full breakdown of the top 9 new gadgets we saw right here. Bottom line is that day 2 was all about the laptops. We saw new machines from MSI, Acer and HP, as well as Dell and its gaming sub-brand, Alienware. Many of these machines arrived sporting new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 (Codenamed Panther Lake) chips. We can't wait to get these laptops into our labs to test them out against their Snapdragon and AMD rivals. But it wasn't just laptops that caught our eye yesterday. For the first time, toy brand Lego held a CES keynote to reveal its first "smart brick" — a standard Lego brick with a tiny computer packed inside that uses NFC to bring Lego sets to life with lights and sounds. @tomsguide ♬ original sound - Tom’s Guide Finally, we got a look at some new mobility solutions, including a voice-controlled four-wheel personal transport vehicle with a 20-mile range and a brand new exoskeleton that our senior fitness writer called one of the most comfortable he's ever worn. It was an action-packed day at CES and we're looking forward to bringing you everything that Day 3 has to offer over the course of the next 24 hours. Read the full story: CES 2026 day 2 — 9 biggest tech and gadget announcements direct from the show floor

Walking exoskeletons continue to take strides forward (Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide) Even if you've not got miles of show floor to cover, an exoskeleton like the Ascentiz H1 Pro can be a much-needed tool for helping users move faster, further or with heavier loads. The particular advantage of this model is its light weight, minimizing the burden that the tech places on the user while maximizing the benefits of motor-assisted walking. If you need something more heavy-duty, you can alternatively go for the Ultra model, which sports increased power, or one of Ascentiz's knee/knee and hip-attached models that offer greater performance over the basic hip-based H1 Pro.

Too many screens? Or not enough? (Image credit: Future) The Asus Zephyrus Duo series has been offering dual-screen gaming on a laptop for some time, but the latest version now features two full-size 16-inch panels, rather than a main screen and a secondary one squeezed above the keyboard deck. Coupled with up to 64GB RAM, an RTX 5090 GPU and an Intel Core Ultra Series 3 CPU, you get immense power as well as an absurd yet awesome design with this laptop. We don't have full pricing or availability details yet, but don't expect all this to come cheap.

Samsung's two new flagship TVs - but which is better? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Samsung has a new top model for its OLED TV series - the S95H. But it's also launched a new Micro RGB set named the R95H. So now it's harder than ever to pick the right model for your needs. Fortunately, we went hands-on with both of Samsung's new TV models, and while the Micro RGB boasts superior brightness and color, the overall image from the OLED screen was the better of the two. That may change when we get to review these TVs properly, but it's at least a convincing early victory for OLED.

A "zero labor" home with a robot? Sign us up! (Image credit: Future) LG outlined its "Zero Labor Home" concept in its LG press conference, which includes the rather adorable CLOiD house robot. Designed to fit in with LG ThinQ products, and using vision and artificial intelligence to help users out, CLOiD can perform tasks like loading a washing machine, and act as a hub for other connected devices. It's only a concept, but it's a dream that countless people have had for decades. Sooner or later it's got to become a reality, right?

Nvidia's new gaming-focused offerings (Image credit: Future) Leather jacket enthusiast and CEO Jensen Huang hosted the Nvidia Live presentation yesterday, telling us all sorts of things about the company's future plans. You can check out the whole presentation above, but the highlights as far as we're concerned, were the announcement of G-Sync Pulsar monitor tech to keep images smooth and sharp as you game, GeForce Now's RTX 5080 update that also introduces Linux support, and DLSS 4.5 - the latest step for AI-improved graphics processing.

A tablet so thin you could almost shave with it (Image credit: Future) We've seen thin tablets before, but Haining Toall has taken it to another level with its super-thin Paper tablet. Despite being a 13-inch slate just like the iPad Pro, the Paper is about 40% thinner at 3.1mm thick. Despite the thinness, there are two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port (albeit in a slightly thicker section), and up to 512GB storage. But with an estimated price of $1,500, and an estimated battery life of just three hours, this may not be ready for the big time just yet.

Portable projection with even more power (Image credit: Samsung) It's 1:30am in Las Vegas right now, so it's a good time to catch up on what happened yesterday while CES attendees sleep (or continue to party - it's the Vegas Strip after all). Let's start with Samsung's new Freestyle+ projector, the latest in Samsung's portable projector line that puts its obligatory AI features to use for image quality purposes, adapting the image to the distance from the wall, the material and more to keep things looking crispy. A new 360-degree speaker and higher 430-lumen brightness round out the improvements.

Nvidia DLSS 4.5 is a boon for gamers (Image credit: Nvidia) Nvidia's DLSS technology just got a big boost at CES 2026. With the new DLSS 4.5, you can now experience 4K path-traced gaming at a whopping 240 fps. The AI-fueled feature combines super resolution and frame generation for better performance when gaming. Our own Jason England got a demo, and the result is better picture stability, reduced ghosting and other enhancements. Get the full scoop on DLSS 4.5 now

That's a wrap on CES 2026 Day 1 (Image credit: Future) And that's it for day one of CES 2026. We've covered a lot today from the latest from Intel and Nvidia to fun gadgets and excellent new laptops from Dell and Asus. Plus, a long look at LG's CLOiD robot which stole the show today. We'll be back tomorrow with more coverage of all the tech and gadgets being shown off at CES this year. So keep an eye on Tom's Guide as we explore the showroom floor.

Checking out the bonkers Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo (Image credit: Future) Asus got weird at CES 2026 with the dual-screen ROG Zephyrus Duo. Tom's Guide's Jason England got to check out the 16-inch gaming laptop. "While I’m sure the price will be truly ludicrous, I can’t help but hold a soft spot for this as one of the coolest laptops I’ve seen so far this decade," he said.

Hands on with the return of the Dell XPS (Image credit: Future) Dell is bringing back the XPS line after abandoning it for the strange Premium branding. My colleague, Mark Spoonauer, spent some time with the new XPS laptops at CES. Like other PC MacBook Pro competitors, it is more expensive but he found that it has a lot to justify the premium pricing.

And that's a wrap! (Image credit: Future) Intel Core Ultra Series 3 products will be available...starting tomorrow! As in, January 6, so it really won't be long until we find out just how well these CPUs perform. Stay tuned for a hands-on look at the chip and what it can offer. Oh, and plenty more major announcements at CES 2026. Keep it right here!

Intel built for Edge (Image credit: Future) Compared to Nvidia's Jetson Orin, the Intel Core Ultra X9 will have 1.7x better performance in image classification, 1.9x LLM Latency, and 2.3x video analytics. Shots fired at Team Green, it seems!

Perplexity AI makes an appearance (Image credit: Future) Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has come on stage to talk about local compute how much faster it is with minimal latency, better security and control. Essentially, Srinivas talks about how localized compute is becoming more prevalent. Srinivas also talks about the cost, and how local compute becomes more cost-effective to take pressure off these costly data centers. We're moving more towards localized AI.

Intel on local AI (Image credit: Future) As you might expect, Intel is doubling down on all things local AI, working with Microsoft to make the most of Copilot+ PC features and more. Expect 180 TOPS, up to 120 GPU TOPS and up to 96GB DDR5x. So prepare for a new Intel AI era that's able to handle local and cloud artificial intelligence right on your PC.

BREAKING: Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will have a big focus on handheld gaming (Image credit: Future) It's not just for laptops and PCS! Intel just confirmed it will be launching a suite of handheld gaming consoles boasting Intel Core Ultra Series 3. We'll have to wait and see what this looks like, but it's sure to be a hit with the specs Team Blue just announced.

Battlefield 6 runs 'remarkable' on Panther Lake (Image credit: Future) EA has been working with Intel to make sure Battlefield 6 is optimized for Core Ultra 3, and it's working on a native integration of XeSS to make sure those frame rates run smooth.

Prepare for a big Arc graphics upgrade (Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide) Panther Lake has 70% more gaming performance than Lunar Lake, and it's been tested across a range of games, including Cyberpunk 2077 to Returnal toRed Dead Redemption 2. Games like Painkiller and Delta Force will runs at over 120 FPS according to Intel. That's all based on the GPU on chip, by the way! With XeSS 3, you can expect ray tracing and AI-generated frames. That's right, there's AI-based multi-frame generation. With Overkill settings with super resolution, the Arc B390 (the name of the iGPU) can offer 145 FPS. Impressive stuff.

'Fundamentals still matter' (Image credit: Future) The next step of the journey for Intel is here, with Intel Core Ultra Series 3 being built with Intel 18A, and it's now officially announced! Apparently, it's the most "advanced process in the world," with new e-core, p-cores, Xe cores and more. What I'm really looking forward to is the graphics these chips can achieve. The GPU tile is now on its own chiplet, which equals fantastic performance when it comes to graphics. Otherwise, think better performance, battery efficiency and much longer battery life.

Intel Core Ultra Series 3 is here (Image credit: Future) SVP Jim Johnson is now here to talk about what's coming this year, and yes, Intel Core Ultra Series 3 is here with a panther in the background of the show. Johnson talks about the investment Intel has made in the U.S. for new tools and Intel 18A being the center of that effort, stating it's a "big milestone." Essentially, up to 15% better performance per watt and up to 30% better chip density. It's impressive stuff.

And we're kicking off with Intel's CEO on stage (Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is kicking off the show and giving us a recap of Intel's past year, and what to expect (including the Ultra Series 3) along with Intel's push for an AI-driven future.

Kicking off in under 2 minutes... (Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide) Get the popcorn out (I wish I had some, and no one else seems to have any to share either), as the event is kicking off in under two minutes! No telling how long it will last, so prepare for a long one.

And the countdown begins (Image credit: Future / Tom's Guide) It's getting packed over at Intel's keynote, and we're now 10 minutes away from all the big announcements from Team Blue. So far, I'm staring at a (fittingly) blue screen. While we wait, don't forget to check out what Nvidia is announcing!

Gearing up for Intel Core Ultra Series 3! Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Launch Event Livestream | Intel​ - YouTube Watch On Darragh here, and I've got a front row seat at Intel's big keynote on all things Core Ultra Series 3 (a.k.a.

The Nvidia stage (Image credit: Future) We're inside the theater for the Nvidia keynote. Here's what it looks like. It reminds me of one of the cauldrons from Horizon Forbidden West where the robot animals are made. Here's a closer look: (Image credit: Future)

Nvidia press conference starting soon and the line is looooooong (Image credit: Future) Nvidia's massive CES 2026 press conference is going to kick off soon, and my colleague Jason England will be attending, if he can get in. The line apparently spans 2 floors! The show starts at 4 PM ET / 1 PM PT.



Don't worry, we'll get in and have coverage of everything Team Green announces.

Breaking: Hisense 2026 TV lineup revealed (Image credit: Hisense) Hisense is coming into 2026 strong with a new lineup of UR9 and UR8 RGB Mini-LED TVs. Plus, a huge micro-LED upgrade in the 163MX.

We broke it all down here exploring everything Hisense announced plus what we expect to see once we get our eyes on the sets.

A real life Vibroblade @tomsguide ♬ original sound - Tom’s Guide At first glance, this vibrating chef's knife seems very silly. However, it could be a solution for people who want to cook but don't have good hand strength or need help with cutting.

That said, the $399 starting price is not enticing when you can get a quality chef's knife for far less. Still, we're curious.

A brief look at LG's new home robot @tomsguide ♬ original sound - Tom’s Guide LG showed off its new CLOiD robot at CES and it made quite the splash. It's an AI-powered home robot, which you can see in the video above. LG revealed the bot as part of its "Zero Labor Home" vision, and we got a brief look at the friendly-looking automaton.

First look at the Lego Smart Brick @tomsguide ♬ original sound - Tom’s Guide The first ever public demo of the Lego Smart Brick and Smart minifigures shows off type of brick.

These new Lego feature tags and spatial awareness so that it can tell where it is in relation to a minifigure or make noises depending on what kind of build its used in.

Enter the Lego Smart Brick @tomsguide ♬ original sound - Tom’s Guide During its keynote Lego showed a brief history of the toy and how its changed through the years before introducing the newest kind of Lego, the smart brick. But what does it do?

LEGO is at CES? (Image credit: Future) What is LEGO doing at CES? The company is hosting it's first keynote at the world's biggest tech show to celebrate some special anniversaries... and celebrate the launch of a very special product that powers interactivity with LEGO sets.

CES 2026 Day 1 round up (Image credit: Future) We're boots on the ground in Las Vegas for CES 2026 and we've already seen a variety of new, interesting and occassionaly strange new gadgets and devices. With that in mind, we rounded up a list of the best new products we saw on the first day of CES including the Paper Android tablet that is just 3.1mm thick and the new Samsung S95H OLED TV. Check out our picks to see what's coming in tech this year.

HP takes on the MacBook with the new OmniBook Ultra 14 (Image credit: Future) HP has a new ultra-thin laptop that is 5% thinner than the MacBook Air while offering a 3K OLED touchscreen display. My colleague Mark Spoonauer got some hands on time with the HP Omnibook Ultra 14 2026 at CES and said it looks good so far but he is worried about the price, which is higher than the MacBook Air M4.

L'Oréal has unveiled two light-based devices at CES 2026 (Image credit: L'Oreal) The Light Straight + Multi-styler uses infrared light to straighten hair at 320°F, significantly lower than traditional straighteners that hit 400°F+. Near-infrared light reshapes hydrogen bonds in hair fibers without damaging keratin. L'Oréal claims it works 3x faster and leaves hair 2x smoother than premium competitors. The LED Face Mask is a flexible silicone prototype that delivers red and near-infrared light to target fine lines, sagging, and uneven tone. It aims to firm and smooth skin through light therapy. Also launching in 2027. Pricing details will be available on loreal.com closer to launch.

And that's a wrap for LG (Image credit: Future) LG CLOiD closed out the show and thanked everyone for coming. He'll be at the booth so we can see it up close. Stay locked into the Tom's Guide CES live blog for our impressions of the robot when we get up close and personal.

Data centers LG is getting into data centers now, which is important, but probably a little less exciting for regular tech users.

Tunnel? How about a magical forest instead?! (Image credit: Future) LG also showed how even going through a tunnel could be transformed. It can be like you're traveling through a magical forest using generative AI. Driving might never be boring again.

LG wants your car... (Image credit: Future) LG's new in-car AI system is ready for those who want to lean into the future of autonomous driving. When self-driving is engaged, the left side of the windshield becomes a screen displaying a 3D map, and the right side can be used for on-the-fly shopping.

CLOiD stealing the show? (Image credit: Future) LG circled back to its CLOiD robot, which will be able to help with chores like preparing food, doing laundry, and more. It can also help control LG appliances, bringing all smart devices together into a single functional system.

The smartest of smart fridges (Image credit: Future) LG's new fridge can help you figure out where to store certain foods and at what temperatures. For example, if you want to make sure your meat is fresh and safe, the fridge. And the new Signature oven has built-in cameras and can tell you when your croissants are perfectly cooked.

LG's bringing more AI to TV (Image credit: Future) LG's new webOS TVs have an AI button built right into the remote, analyzing whatever is on your screen so you can learn more. You can ask about chances to win a game, recipes and more. While AI seems to be shoved into just about every piece of tech, this actually sounds like an awesome use case.

Greatness at its thinnest (Image credit: Future) LG is getting into the hardware portion of its presentation, showing off a tiny TV. Not tiny in screen size, but tiny in depth, coming in at 9mm thin, which is about the same depth as a pencil. To show off the new TV, LG brought three sets on stage, and they looked nothing short of impressive. These sets use 165Hz wireless technology via the Zero Connect box, so you don't need to worry about unsightly wires. For picture quality, it has Hyper Radiant Color tech built in, which is now 3.9x brighter than previous models. If you want a TV that's also a conversation piece, this might be worth keeping on your radar.

No chores?! (Image credit: Future) On stage at the LG CES World Premiere, the company showed off what it calls a “Zero Labor Home.” With it, we could see a future where devices and AI work together. The lead device is likely the new CLOiD robot, which helps with chores around the home. Robots will be able to sense, decide and create the best environment on their own. I have to say, the idea of doing no household chores sounds pretty appealing. You can't buy time, but you can put robots to work doing the tedious stuff, giving you more time to do the things you want to do.

'AI should understand people' (Image credit: Future) William Cho, CEO of LG Electronics, says innovation matters only when it improves your life. Cho went further, saying AI should understand people.

Getting ready for LG (Image credit: Future) LG's event is just a few minutes away from starting and we're excited to see what the company has to offer. We'll bring you any new products and news as they happen, but for now, we're waiting outside for the company to let us in.

AI wearables (Image credit: Switchbot) SwitchBot has arrived at CES 2026 this year and joined the list of companies in the AI wearable space with its AI MindClip device. There's been a few AI wearables that have seen mixed success, so it'll be interesting to see how this one does. Details are still sparse on this particular product, it will focus on the user being able to search through ‘memories’ and track down important information that it has recorded in the past.

Govee smart lights bring the color (Image credit: Govee) Govee, a company known for making some of the coolest smart lights, has announced three new models at CES 2026, and they look as beautiful as ever. The company's latest lights have been heavily focused on color, and the Govee Floor Lamp 3, Govee Ceiling Light Ultra and Govee Sky Ceiling Light push the color focus even further.

Headphones that turn into a speaker?! (Image credit: TDM) This seems like such a simple idea that we haven't seen done yet. The Neo Hybrid headphones from a new brand called TDM, or “Tomorrow Doesn’t Matter,” roll up and turn into a Bluetooth speaker for times when you want to share the joy of music. We've seen headphones that double as speakers before, but these are a little different, with a second set of outward-facing 40mm drivers that let you share your music. They sound promising, though, with up to 200 hours in headphone mode and just over 10 hours in speaker mode, since they have to work much harder to pump out louder sound.

AI meets dogs (Image credit: SATELLAI) SATELLAI’s Petsense AI is the world’s first multimodal AI model for pets. It does a little bit of everything — it integrates with the company's cutting-edge tracking dog collars and filters real-time data on a dog’s posture, vocalization, breathing, sleep patterns, activity levels and escape tendencies. Even with all that AI tracking, the new SATELLAI Collar Go will be priced at $79.99, which seems quite reasonable.

Stunning TV from Samsung @tomsguide ♬ r&b loop - Official Sound Studio Check out the video above of the beautiful 130" Micro RGB TV, the "world's first" Micro RGB TV of this size. Could it be the best TV at CES? We'll have to wait to see everything, but it's tracking to be a good one.

The future of gaming laptops? (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Gaming laptops are a competitive space, with expensive, high-end products releasing all the time. One brand that typically makes waves in the gaming laptop market is Asus, and the company's new Zephyrus G14 Panther Lake model is being called "the future of gaming laptops" by Tom's Guide Computing Managing Editor Jason England. He's seen a lot of laptops over his long career, so for him to give something such high praise isn't to be taken lightly. It's certainly exciting for gamers who like playing on the go. It only weighs 3.3 pounds, which is quite light for a powerful gaming laptop. The integrated Intel Arc B390 ran Painkiller at 220 FPS at 1080p high settings, and Dying Light 2 at 140 FPS.

Withings announces Body Scan 2 smart scale (Image credit: Withings) Withings has announced a successor to the Body Scan smart scale at CES 2026. The Body Scan 2 adds a number of new health features, including hypertension detection. It will also use Impedance Cardiography (ICG) to monitor your heart pumping efficiency and Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) to check on your cellular health and metabolic function. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can track over 60 biomarker measurements alongside just telling you your weight and body fat percentage. The smart scale will launch in the second quarter of 2026, pending FDA clearance. Pricing is set at $600 while the original Body Scan will remain available for $399.

Making memories with AI (Image credit: SwitchBot) Smart home company SwitchBot has decided to make a move into the emerging AI wearable category. The AI MindClip is a product akin to the Plaud NotePin: an 18g/0.6oz wearable clip that supports more than 100 languages and listens in to your meetings and conversations throughout the day. Pricing hasn't been revealed yet, but it's expected to be a subscription-based model. While details are still light on this particular product, it will have a focus on its user being able to search through ‘memories’ and track down important information that it has recorded in the past.

Let there be (smart) light! (Image credit: Govee) Govee has revealed three new products at CES this year: the Govee Floor Lamp 3, Govee Ceiling Light Ultra and Govee Sky Ceiling Light. As well a partnership with Samsung SmartThings, in a bid to firmly embed itself in your existing smart home setup. You can read more about the individual products right here. But Govee has also told us its core tech has been improved for 2026. As well as an upgraded LuminBlend+ color system, the brand has now got a more intuitive AI Lighting Bot 2.0 and a new adaptive lighting system, called DaySync. Smart light is getting smarter.

8BitDo reveals a cute iPhone gaming accessory (Image credit: Future) Anyone who likes gaming on their iPhone but can't stand touchscreen controls may be interested in 8BitDo's latest announcement. The controller company has unveiled a cute little gamepad called the 8BitDo FlipPad. It's designed to turn your iPhone or Android device into a pseudo Game Boy with physical controls that flip up from the underside of the phone to turn it into a vertical handheld. The gamepad looks to be powered by the phone's USB-C port. The company is currently showing off the device at CES with a release date scheduled for summer 2026. So far, we don't have any word on pricing. Where mobile play unfolds.Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.Compatible with iOS and Android devices.

What to expect from Qualcomm (Image credit: Future) Qualcomm is likely to be a big presence at CES this year, but the company won't be having a dedicated keynote since it staged its own Snapdragon Summit 2025 in September. The Hawaii-based event gave us a hands-on look at its upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chips coming to laptops in 2026. But despite that, CEO Cristiano Amon will put in a guest appearance at Lenovo Tech World on January 6 at 5 p.m. PST / 8 p.m. EST / 1 a.m. GMT. So it's safe to say we expect Lenovo's upcoming laptops to sport Qualcomm's latest and greatest — but there will be many others, from the likes of Asus and Dell, that'll also be showing off new Snapdragon smarts. @tomsguide ♬ Technology, inorganic cool, techno 10 minutes(998935) - 8.864 Read the full story: Qualcomm at CES 2026: What to expect from Snapdragon X2 series chips

Expect new wearables (Image credit: Dan Bracaglia/Tom's Guide) Expect new releases from more fitness-oriented smartwatch makers, including big boys like Garmin and the more budget-friendly brands like Amazfit. We also expect to get our first look at many of the upcoming smart ring releases for 2026 that aren't named Oura. We can’t confirm any specific new models, but we are looking forward to meeting with brands like Circular, Luna Ring, Ringconn, and Ultrahuman. We're also excited to see what smaller wearables brands have in store, including Pebble, which launched its first smartwatch back in 2013, but is back with some cool new products under the direction of the founder in 2025. Finally, we’ll be on the lookout for all consumer health tech products that can help you monitor your well-being, improve your health, or assist you in reaching fitness goals in a minimally invasive and/or seamless manner. From smart rings and trackers to stick-on sensors and bodily fluid analyzers, there is no shortage of tech in this category to feed my curiosity.

New smart home tech (Image credit: Future) We expect greater innovations with robot vacuums this year, as designs evolve even further. While it wasn’t as radical, Dreame last year introduced a vacuum that could climb two-inch thresholds. Could robot vacuums get to the next level, literally and figuratively, with models that can go even higher? We also expect to see an influx of Matter-compatible home security cameras, as the Matter standard was just updated to allow for their use. That’s going to mean you’ll see a lot more cameras that will be able to work within the Apple Home ecosystem as well as Alexa and Google Home. And, while we've already seen most security camera makers incorporate AI into their devices to better identify people and things that appear on the footage, we expect to see even further refinement for more granular details.

This super-thin tablet makes the iPad Pro look bloated (Image credit: Future) Sorry, iPad Pro, but you're no longer as thin as you used to be. We just got to check out an ultra-thin Android tablet that's appropriately called the Paper. Made by the Chinese company Haining Toall Technology, this Android device measures just 3.1mm thick. For those scoring at home, the iPad Pro M5 is 5.1mm thin. The Paper tablet features a 13-inch AMOLED display, and it's so thin that the ports are stored in a raised area that's slightly thicker. You get two USB-C ports and a mini HDMI port. This bump also makes the slate a bit easier to hold. The company told us it will be available in 256GB and 512GB versions, and the starting price is $1,500. When we asked about the CPU, a company rep told us that Paper will be powered by a Chinese processor.. so perhaps it's MediaTek? This all sounds fantastic, but what about battery life? Unfortunately, this slate's endurance is as thin as its design, as we were told the Paper is rated for only 3 hours of run time. However, you'll be able to get battery life with the case... which will no doubt make the tablet thicker. We don't have a release date for the Paper in the U.S., but you can bet we'll test it out if it ever lands here.

Laptops could dominate CES (Image credit: Tom's Guide) We think 2026 will be the year of the laptop, and we expect to see a whole ton of them debuting during CES. If you've been holding off on upgrading your laptop or buying one for the first time, this might be the best time to jump aboard. That's because we're seeing major developments in chip technology coming in the form of Intel Core Ultra 300 Series (Panther Lake), AMD Ryzen AI 400 series (Gorgon Point) and AI Max series (Strix Halo), and Snapdragon X2 Elite. All are set to push the latest systems to another level. OLED will dominate displays, and you’ll hear a whole lot about power efficiency, because who doesn't want a long-lasting laptop? But probably most surprising is the huge leaps in integrated graphics. For PC gaming on the go, a dedicated Nvidia GPU was always a requirement, but with what we saw testing Intel and Qualcomm’s latest chips, we’re getting to a point where you could get a thin and light notebook that just so happens to game really well, too!

Biggest trend to watch: Smart glasses (Image credit: Tom's Guide) In our CES 2026 preview, we spotlighted six trends to watch out for. Here, let's highlight one in particular, smart glasses. This one likely won't come as a surprise if you've seen how popular these devices have become in just a few short years. Now, we're at a point where AR and AI glasses could merge into truly smart frames. We think 2026 will be the year we finally start to see this happening. And we expect it to kick off in Vegas. That's because the tools you need are already being shown: Subtle display tech: Waveguide displays will be all over the place at CES.

Waveguide displays will be all over the place at CES. The chips to run it: Expect some developments from the likes of Qualcomm to run these glasses.

A whole lot of companies are reaching out to show me their breakthroughs in sensor tech to make smart glasses smarter. The software: Android XR is drawing near, and other companies are jumping on the bandwagon. As we've seen over the years, smart companies like these are where the big players get the components to power devices like the Meta Ray-Bans. Additionally, AR glasses will also move forward when it comes to affordability and display quality. This could deliver the best way to play games or watch movies on a long haul flight.

We went hands with the world's thinnest OLED TV! LG Wallpaper OLED Hands-On! World’s Thinnest OLED TV at CES 2026 - YouTube Watch On At CES 2026, Kate goes hands-on with the LG OLED evo W6 Wallpaper TV, the world’s thinnest OLED TV, now paired with wireless connectivity. With a flush-to-the-wall, 9 millimeter design, no visible ports, and all inputs moved to LG’s Zero Connect Box, this TV is designed to disappear into your space. This new Wallpaper OLED also debuts Hyper Radiant Color Technology, LG’s brightest OLED performance yet, with improved color, deeper blacks, and dramatically reduced screen reflections. It’s powered by LG’s latest Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen 3, supports 4K at 165Hz, and delivers the full flagship OLED experience in a design that looks more like art than a TV.

Become the rock star (Image credit: Tom's Guide) Our very own Mike Prospero is channeling his inner Eddie Van Halen thank to the LiberLive C2. This peripheral should release in March and upgrades the original by featuring more frets. It can even sound like a piano if you want to get your keytar on! There will also be inputs for effects pedals and a microphone. Pricing should be around $500, which is still cheaper than a rockstar's hotel bill.

More Samsung TV models slated for 2026 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) In addition to two new flagship OLEDs, Samsung has also detailed its full 2026 TV lineup during CES. Last year, Samsung launched a room-dominating, 115-inch Micro RGB TV that, unsurprisingly, cost tens of thousands of dollars. This year, the brand is expanding its stable of Micro RGB TVs with at least one new series. Samsung's latest Micro RGB TV will arrive in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, and 100-inch screen sizes. Don't expect them to come cheap, but at the very least, shoppers looking to splash out on this fancy, cutting-edge TV tech will have several size options to choose from. Samsung's Neo QLED TVs blend Mini-LED backlighting, quantum dot color, and Samsung's robust picture processing capabilities. We don't know much about Samsung's 2026 Neo QLED TV lineup yet, but there's already good news for people who love big screens. Both the Samsung QN80H and the Samsung QN70H — two of the brand's Neo QLED TVs for 2026 — will arrive in gargantuan, 100-inch versions. They're replacing the Samsung QN80F and the QN70F, respectively. They will also likely be able to buy them in different sizes. Samsung hasn't forgotten about its AI ambitions, and in 2026, the TV-maker will continue to develop AI-based features for its newest slate of TVs. For instance, Samsung's AI Sound Controller is a new feature that makes on-the-fly adjustments to the soundscape of movies and shows. AI Motion Enhancer Pro purportedly allows for smoother, clearer motion during select content. Additionally, all of Samsung's newest Micro RGB TVs leverage something called Micro RGB AI Engine Pro, which is said to enhance color realism on a frame-by-frame basis.

Samsung has two flagship OLEDs in 2026 (Image credit: Tom's Guide) It's going to be challenging picking a Samsung TV in 2026. That's because the company has two flagship models that utilize vastly different technologies, both of which are equally impressive. The two Samsung flagships vying for a spot in your living room in 2026 are the new Samsung S95H OLED (the successor to last year’s award-winning S95F OLED) and the all-new R95H, Samsung’s first-ever Micro RGB TV. The Samsung S95H is going to be a movie-lover’s dream. It sports those perfect black levels that you’ve come to expect from Samsung Display’s self-emissive QD-OLED panels and combines it with the brand’s Glare-Free technology. Even on the brightly lit show floor, I had no problem seeing every single detail in the demo content Samsung had playing on repeat. Samsung's R95H is as bright as any Mini-LED TV we’ve seen, but it has a slightly larger color volume. Scenes from "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" we watched on the Samsung S95D OLED looked significantly brighter and richer on the R95H. We'll need a closer look at both screens later this year, but as it stands right now, the S95H has a slight edge on the R95H. Read more in our article where we got to see these flagship OLED and Micro RGB TVs side by side.

LG Wallpaper OLED TV is back @tomsguide ♬ Beautiful Minimal Tech House - Yuki Takasaki Meet the LG OLED evo W6 — a.k.a. The LG Wallpaper TV. Like the LG OLED evo M5 that was unveiled at last year’s CES, the W6 model will use the Zero Connect Box to beam information from up to 10 meters (30 feet) away. However, what sets the W6 apart from its predecessor is that it will include new backlight technology (dubbed Hyper Radiant Color Technology) for improved black levels, color vibrancy, and brightness, plus a newly designed anti-reflective screen. According to LG, the W6 is just 9mm thick. On average, that’s thinner than the LG G5 OLED and LG C5 OLED from 2025, though the latter does have part of its screen that’s 6.35mm thick — a hair thinner than the W6. In terms of brightness, LG claims the W6 is up to 3.9 times brighter than "conventional OLEDs." In HDR, last year's LG B5 OLED reached around 600 nits in Standard mode in our testing. A 3.9x increase would put the W6 Series at around 2,340 nits in a 10% window in Standard HDR, which does seem plausible considering the LG G5 reached almost 1,900 nits in the same test. Of course, better brightness and thinner screens usually come at a cost, usually to the tune of several thousand dollars. The good news is that LG told our Global Editor-in-Chief Mark Spoonauer that the W6 won't be much more than its OLED stablemates. Considering the 65-inch W7 launched back in 2017 for $7,999, and the 77-inch model came in at an eye-watering $19,999, this is very good news.

Give yourself a dope fade (Image credit: Future) Yes, I cringed just as hard as you did reading that subheadline, but stick with me here. Why pay for a barbers to give you a fade, when you could use Glyde Smart Hair Clippers to do it for you? As you can see, this is quite the over-the-top construction including a wearable crown that ensures a hard cut-off line as to not go too extreme with your fade and match it up to your facial dimensions, and the additional element on the clippers can change the grading in real-time to let the hair be longer at key intervals.

This robot vacuum comes with its own mothership (Image credit: Future) The Dreame X60 Ultra is the highly anticipated robot vacuum sequel that packs a new slimmer profile for subtle cleaning around the house. But you're not limited to just one floor anymore by the $1,399 device. That slightly terrifying quadraped you see in the back is the CyberX dock. Previously, the dock's just been a stationary location for your hoover to charge. Now it can navigate up stairs for you to get to different hard-to-reach rooms. No price yet, but this could be a breakthrough for never having to worry about vacuum cleaning again.

Nobody tell Disney about the adorable Zeroth W1! (Image credit: Future) Faster than you can say "Wall-E," we just bumped into the Zeroth W1. While I do find it weird to call a robot "cute," that's the only way I can describe it to be honest! This friendly companion is build to support you in three key ways around the home: home security with 360-degree surveillance, following you around in the great outdoors, and providing AI assisted filming and media companionship. And it's impressively fully featured too with a massive battery, all the sensors including 3D LiDAR and Ultrasonic, alongside both remote and voice control.

Skiing without the snow!? (Image credit: Future) Because electric scooters are just too boring for the morning commute, now you can ski through the streets instead! Skwheel is an interesting oddity we spotted (and tested) at CES Unveiled tonight — packing electric motors and a remote to control the speed. The rep told us it takes "about 20 minutes" to get the hang the precise tilt control for effectively carving turns like you would on a traditional pair of skis. To someone who has two left feet, I'm calling "sus" on that!

This modular skeleton will help you through the toughest journeys (Image credit: Ascentiz) After its record-breaking Kickstarter, Ascentiz has decided to bring a finished version of its exoskeleton system to CES 2026. The systems range in price from $1,499 to $3399, and cover two distinct use-cases: "The Ascentiz-H employs a high-torque quasi-direct-drive system for the hip, while the Ascentiz-K utilizes an advanced cable-drive mechanism for the knee." If you need help moving around, or have plans for tackling an extreme outdoor adventure and want a fallback plan in case it gets too intense, this relatively affordable exoskeleton has you covered.

Fraimic Smart Canvas lets you create art with your voice Introducing Fraimic: The Smart E Ink Canvas That Turns Your Voice Into Art - YouTube Watch On Get ready for "art that listens." It's a cinch to create AI generated images using the likes of Gemini and ChatGPT, but how about on your wall? Enter the Fraimic Smart Canvas, which will be on display at CES 2026 and will be available in two sizes starting at $399. This E-Ink screen lets you use voice to speak your ideas directly into the smart canvas. The voice-to-vision technology is powered by OpenAI, no app required. The two sizes are 14 x 8 and 24 x 35, and Fraimic promises multi-year battery life. You can pre-order now at fraimic.com

This AI robot vacuum won't suck up your valuables (Image credit: Narwal) We've seen robot vacuums that can identify obstacles and avoid them, but the new Narwal Flow 2 goes a step further. It leverages AI to identify objects and it can tag them (such as jewelry, wallet, etc) while keeping a safe distance of at least 5cm. It can even send you a photo of the item to your phone via the Narwal app. Launching in April, the Narwal Flow 2 offers a number of cleaning upgrades, including 30,000Pa of suction (upr from 22,000Pa on the original Flow) and 158°F hot water mopping.

Govee just reinvented the ceiling light Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Govee) (Image credit: Govee) Govee is kicking off CES by launching two new ceiling lights. The one I'm keen on is the Sky Ceiling Light, which is designed to mimic daylight. Think clear-sky tones and soft skylight transitions, so this is a good bet for spaces that have little to no windows. The second device is the Govee Ceiling Light Ultra, which packs a 616-pixel LED matrix for vivid patterns and animations. Thanks to Govee's AI Lighting Bot 2.0, you get dynamic lighting effects. You can display over 20 lighting effect presets or create your own. No pricing or availability yet.

How to watch Nvidia's big CES 2026 Keynote (Image credit: Future) The most anticipated CES 2026 keynote is always Nvidia, and that's because CEO Jensen Huang knows how to put on a show. We have a full guide to how to watch the Nvidia CES 2026 keynote, which kicks off on Monday, January 5 at 1pm PT / 4pm ET / 9pm GMT. What to expect? Nvidia's site says it will be about “what’s next in AI in a special presentation.” We could also see what's next for robotics and self-driving, as well as gaming — but we don't expect the RTX 50 SUPER Series or RTX 60-series GPUs just yet.

Charge (and Protect) Your Switch 2 Anywhere (Image credit: Belkin) I already know what I'm getting my daughter for her birthday this year. Belkin has announced the Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 at CES 2026, which packs a removable 10,000 mAh power bank for delivering up to 30W of fast charging and features its own LCD to display battery life. You can even recharge the power bank externally without opening the case, and the hinged design doubles as a tabletop stand. Not bad at all for $99 — and it's available now at belkin.com

SwitchBot AI MindClip is your 'second brain' (Image credit: SwitchBot) If you're constantly forgetting stuff and don't have time to jot notes down, the SwitchBot AI MindClip is here to help. Giving the Plaude NotePin some competition, the MindClip records your daily life and work meetings, then creates AI-powered summaries and task lists for you. The devices weighs just 18 grams and supports over 100 languages. Unfortunately, we don't know the price or release date yet so stay tuned.

Seriously Powerful AR Glasses (Image credit: Future) The leader in AR glasses is back at it here at CES 2026 with a new pair of powerful specs, and we already have our full Xreal 1S review live. According to computing editor Jason England, these are the best AR glasses you can buy right now. For $449, you get 1200p full HD resolution and the ability to convert 2D videos to 3D, thanks to a robust X1 chip. They're even $50 cheaper than the previous model. If you pair the Xreal X1S with the Switch 2 with the Neo hub, you can game on the go with the equivalent of a movie theater screen on your face.

LG CLOiD is Coming to Fold Your Laundry Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: LG) (Image credit: LG) (Image credit: LG) (Image credit: LG) I know, I know. We've been promised truly helpful home robots for ages, but LG says its AI-powered home robot called LG CLOiD will help humanity get closer to a "Zero Labor Home" here at CES 2026. The CLOiD robot uses AI and vision-based tech to perform mundane tasks like cooking and laundry. The robot features a head unit, torso with two articulated arms and a wheeled base that's capable of autonomous navigation. Each arm has seven degrees of freedom, and each hand have five actuated fingers for "fine manipulation." We'll see LG CLOiD perform various demos, such as retrieving milk from the fridge, as well as folding and stacking garments. Stay tuned for our impressions.
