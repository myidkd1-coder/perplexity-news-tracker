Common diabetes drugs may do more than regulate blood sugar—they could also influence how cancers grow, spread, or slow down. Researchers are now unraveling how these medications affect immune ...

Dry eye disease affects millions of people, causing burning, redness, and constant eye fatigue that can worsen over time. Scientists now believe the problem may begin deep inside tear glands, where a ...

A new imaging technology can distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy cells by detecting ultra-weak light signals. It relies on nanoparticles that bind to tumor markers, making cancerous areas ...

Scientists studying thousands of rats discovered that gut bacteria are shaped by both personal genetics and the genetics of social partners. Some genes promote certain microbes that can spread ...

Letting a swear word fly when you’re struggling might do more than blow off steam—it could actually make you stronger. Research published by the American Psychological Association found that ...

New research suggests Alzheimer’s may start far earlier than previously thought, driven by a hidden toxic protein in the brain. Scientists found that an experimental drug, NU-9, blocks this early ...
