Discover the Silent Superpower: Why India Matters for Investors

On Thursday, January 29 (from 5pm), together with RootBridge, we will turn our attention to a country whose global significance in economics, trade, and geopolitics is rising rapidly: India. Register for the event Participation is subject to confirmation.

Over the past decades, India has emerged as a formidable economic power. With more than 1.4 billion inhabitants and a comparatively young demographic profile, it offers a longer-lasting labour-force and consumption tailwind.

The country is now among the globe’s largest markets. According to the latest estimates for 2025, India’s gross domestic product stands at around $4.1 trillion, making it the fifth-largest economy worldwide, with robust growth forecasts ahead.

Strong Growth Case

Since 2010, the Indian economy has expanded strongly. Real GDP growth has frequently surpassed global averages, supported by a large workforce, rapid urbanization and increasing integration into global value chains. While GDP per capita remains relatively low — around $2,800 (nominal) — it has risen considerably over the past decade.

Unlike some other major powers, India’s ascent has not been accompanied by overt geopolitical posturing. It has largely managed to navigate rising global tensions with a focus on economic resilience and regional engagement.

Economic Modernization

Last year’s tariff disputes with the United States generated headlines and controversy, but they also reinforced New Delhi’s commitment to deregulation in key sectors and economic modernization.

At the same time, the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), including Switzerland, signed in March 2024 and entered into force on 1 October 2025 after parliamentary approval, marks a major step toward deeper economic integration with Europe.

India at Davos

These themes are clearly echoed at the current World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos. India’s delegation has emphasized finance, investment and economic cooperation, in line with its broader global posture.

The country’s representation includes an impressive line-up of corporate and public leaders, including several ministers attending key panels and discussions.

Fostering Financial Ties

While Prime Minister Narendra Modi opted not to share the main stage with some of his Western counterparts this year, India’s economic narrative remains a focal point.

The reception to be hosted on Thursday by the Swiss-Indian Chamber of Commerce further underscores the country’s commitment to fostering strategic business and financial ties worldwide.

A Timely Exchange in Zurich

Against this backdrop, the finews and RootBridge evening event on Thursday, January 29, at 5pm at Zunfthaus zur Saffran could not be more timely.

Hosted in honor of India’s Republic Day celebrated earlier in the week, it brings together business leaders and institutional investors to explore:

What to expect from India in the coming years

How investors can benefit from its ongoing urbanization curve

Which cultural and structural aspects are crucial for successful engagement
