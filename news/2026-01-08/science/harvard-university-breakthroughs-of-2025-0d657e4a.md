## Summary
Harvard’s 2025 research roundup highlights advances across medicine, physics, engineering, and astronomy. Notable work includes an AI model (PopEVE) to speed rare disease diagnosis by prioritizing harmful genetic variants, progress toward scalable quantum computing, GLP-1 drugs shown to cut heart failure hospitalizations, and a smart patch that reduces cravings for alcohol and drugs. Other teams developed aerodynamic shape-shifting materials, ultra-cold imaging methods for materials, energy-saving membranes that pull water vapor from air, and new insights into nearby black holes and cosmic explosions.
