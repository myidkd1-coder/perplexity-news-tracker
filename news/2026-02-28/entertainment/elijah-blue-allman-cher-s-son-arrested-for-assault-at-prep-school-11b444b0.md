A group at a Washington D.C. restaurant was talking openly in the bar area Friday afternoon about a national secret that was about to literally explode hours later -- the bombing of Iran.

Attorney Mark Geragos was at Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab at around 3:00 PM ET, getting something to eat and preparing to do the "2 Angry Men" podcast with Harvey Levin ... from his seat in the bar area.

Just before 3:45, Mark overheard people at the next table in the bar area talking about Iran. There were 4 men sitting at a high-top table, and 2 women were standing next to the table. The men were dressed in business attire ... sports coats and collared shirts. Mark says one of the men said in a voice loud enough for him to clearly hear ... the U.S. was going to bomb Iran "today."
