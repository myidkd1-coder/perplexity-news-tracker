## Full Article
Narendra Modi’s Israel visit comes at a pivotal geopolitical moment. Calling Benjamin Netanyahu a “dear friend”, the Prime Minister signals continuity in a partnership that spans defence, cyber security, innovation and trade. But the bigger headline is Netanyahu’s “hexagon alliance” pitch, a proposed bloc of nations including India to counter radical Shia and Sunni networks in the region. With new defence pacts emerging between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and Iran at the centre of tensions, the region is in flux. India must now balance its strong ties with Israel and its wider interests in the Arab world. Modi’s address to the Knesset and high level talks could shape how New Delhi positions itself in this evolving security architecture.
