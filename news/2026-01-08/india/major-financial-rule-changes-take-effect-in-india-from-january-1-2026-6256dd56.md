## Full Article
As 2025 draws to a close, the new year promises more than just new calendars and resolutions. Starting January 1, 2026, several policy and regulatory changes will take effect, affecting farmers, salaried professionals, youth, and the general public. Key areas set for updates include banking regulations, fuel pricing, and various government schemes. Here are some financial rule changes in India starting January 1, 2026, that will impact banking, taxation, and household budgets:

Mandatory PAN-Aadhaar Linking

If you haven't linked your PAN and Aadhaar yet, you might face issues with banking and government services. From now on, linking is mandatory to avoid account freezes and service blocks. This will disrupt tax filing, refunds, and access to major banking services. Get it done ASAP to stay on the safe side.

8th Pay Commission Implementation

December 31, 2025, marks the end of the 7th Pay Commission's term, and the 8th Pay Commission is set to kick in from January 1, 2026. This means central government employees and pensioners can expect changes in their salaries and pensions, although the actual hike might take some time to reflect.

Weekly Credit Score Updates

Instead of the current 15-day cycle, credit bureaus will now refresh customer data every week. This means loan repayments or defaults will reflect much faster in your credit score, directly affecting loan eligibility.

Revised LPG and Fuel Prices

Prices for domestic and commercial LPG cylinders, as well as Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), are set for revision on January 1, which may impact household budgets and airfares.

New Farmer IDs for PM-Kisan

The Indian government has introduced a new Farmer ID system for the PM-Kisan scheme, making it mandatory for new applicants from January 1, 2025. This digital ID links farmers' land records, crop information, Aadhaar, and bank details, ensuring transparency and efficient benefit transfer. Existing beneficiaries aren't affected, but new applicants must register to receive the Rs 6,000 annual support.

New Income Tax Return (ITR) Forms

Taxpayers can expect a revamped income tax return (ITR) form from January 2026, which will likely come pre-filled with banking and spending details. This move aims to simplify the filing process while also increasing scrutiny to minimise errors and omissions

Enhanced Digital Payment Security

Banks will implement stricter checks on UPI transactions and more robust SIM verification norms for messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to curb fraud.

New Co-Lending Rules

Effective January 1, 2026, the Reserve Bank Of India's updated co-lending framework requires each lender to retain at least 10% of the loan on their own books to ensure fair risk-sharing
