As India's Budget 2026 approaches, investors and tax professionals are demanding significant changes to the capital gains tax regime. Key proposals include lowering the 12.5% Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax, increasing exemption limits, and restoring indexation benefits. However, many experts view a substantial rate cut as unlikely, citing global standards and fiscal needs, with incremental adjustments more probable.

Investor Hopes Rise for Budget 2026 Tax Reforms

New Delhi – Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, a chorus of investors and tax professionals is calling for significant adjustments to India’s capital gains tax structure. Their primary demand centers on a reduction in the Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax rate, alongside increased exemption thresholds and the reintroduction of indexation benefits to shield real returns from inflation.

The push for reform comes less than a year after a substantial overhaul in July 2024. This previous budget unified the LTCG tax rate at 12.5% across various asset classes including equities, mutual funds, real estate, and gold. However, holding periods and specific exemption limits, such as the ₹1.25 lakh threshold for equity mutual funds, remain points of contention.

Calls for Rate Cuts and Uniformity

Proponents of a lower LTCG rate argue that reducing it from 12.5% to 10% would directly enhance net investor returns, thereby fostering a stronger culture of long-term investment. They also seek more uniform holding periods across different asset types. This would simplify tax planning and encourage sustained capital commitment.

However, a considerable segment of market participants expects the upcoming budget to feature only incremental changes. Instead of a rollback of rates, the focus is more likely to be on raising the tax-free income threshold or refining the holding period rules.

Expert Division on Likelihood of Relief

The prospect of a direct rate cut faces significant skepticism from financial experts. Vinayak Magotra, Product Head at Centricity WealthTech, believes a reduction is improbable. "Equity markets are already experiencing peak domestic inflows, and the government has minimal incentive to lower a levy that is considered low by international standards," Magotra stated. He added that the current tax framework provides much-needed clarity and fairness while ensuring fiscal revenue collection.

Magotra also pointed out that with investor participation expanding into smaller cities, policy efforts should prioritize financial inclusion and ease of investment over tax concessions.

Conversely, Monjit Gogoi, founder of Alphamarket, views a lower LTCG rate as a potential catalyst, especially amidst global economic headwinds. "Reducing LTCG to 10% would encourage investors to remain invested longer and help mitigate short-term market volatility," Gogoi explained. He also highlighted longstanding demands from the salaried class for higher income tax exemptions to stimulate consumption.

Indexation Benefits Remain a Key Demand

The debate over indexation benefits, which adjust taxable gains for inflation, also persists. Mihir Tanna, Associate Director, Direct Tax at S.K. Patodia & Associate LLP, echoed the view that a significant rate cut is unlikely. "A unified 12.5% LTCG rate was implemented recently, and the exemption limit was only raised to ₹1.25 lakh after seven years. Further reductions may not be a priority," Tanna noted.

Tanna did acknowledge that some clarity on the scope of indexation might be expected, as benefits were partially restored for residential property acquired before July 23, 2024, for resident taxpayers.

While investor expectations for a substantial revision of the capital gains tax regime are high heading into Budget 2026, the consensus among many experts leans towards the government implementing fine-tuning adjustments rather than sweeping policy overhauls.
