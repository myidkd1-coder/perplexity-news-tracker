## Summary
The government is likely to assume about 10% nominal GDP growth for FY27 in the coming Union Budget, higher than the estimated 8% for the current fiscal. Officials say robust real growth and a base-effect-driven rise in inflation could support faster nominal expansion. A higher nominal growth assumption would aid fiscal deficit and debt-ratio targets.
