## Full Article
For the first time in India's fiscal history, the Union Budget is set to be presented on a Sunday. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to table the Union Budget for 2026-27 in the Lok Sabha at 11 am on February 1.

The 1999 Budget?

Earlier, the Budget used to be presented on the last working day of February. In 1999, when February 28 fell on a Sunday, then Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government presented it a day earlier, on February 27, a Saturday.

The 1999 Budget was also historic because until then, Union Budgets were presented in the evening at around 5 pm. It was a holdover from British colonial practice, when timing announcements to coincide with London's daytime was considered useful. Sinha's presentation shifted the schedule to 11 am, a change that has since become the standard time for Budget announcements in India.

Why Budget Is Presented On February 1

Since 2017, successive governments have presented the Union Budget on February 1, moving it forward from the earlier end-February schedule. The reform was aimed at giving Parliament adequate time to debate, approve and operationalise Budget proposals before the start of the new financial year on April 1.
