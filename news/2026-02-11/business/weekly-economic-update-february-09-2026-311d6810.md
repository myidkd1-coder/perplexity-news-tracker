## Summary

## Full Article
Stocks were mixed last week, with broad gains on Monday and Friday bookending midweek selling pressure as investors digested earnings results from more than 100 S&P 500 companies.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ended the week roughly where it started, slipping 0.10 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 1.84 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.50 percent. By contrast, the MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks developed overseas stock markets, rose 0.49 percent.1,2

Dow 50,000

Stocks bounded out of the gate on Monday with the Dow leading a broad rise across all three major averages. Markets rose in anticipation of a big week for Q4 corporate reports.3

Market sentiment quickly changed on Tuesday as anxious investors appeared to rotate out of technology names and into cyclical areas of the economy more likely to rebound with an improving economy.

News on Wednesday that private-sector job growth slowed in January added to investor anxiety. Stocks fell again on Thursday, with the S&P 500 briefly going negative year-to-date.4,5

Then things turned around.

Stocks rebounded broadly on Friday as investors appeared to “buy the dip.” The Dow led, closing above the 50,000 level for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed back above 23,000, while the S&P gained 2 percent. The latest University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment rose to its highest level in six months, helping buoy investor sentiment.6

Fed Watch: Jobs Data

The brief government shutdown that ended last week delayed several economic reports. The federal employment report for January, originally due out on February 6, has been delayed until Wednesday, February 11.

But payroll processor ADP reported on Wednesday that private employers added 22,000 jobs in January—about half of the 45,000 expected. Then, on Thursday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that companies cut more than 108,000 jobs in January—the highest number of layoffs of any January since 2009.7,8

Investors tried to reconcile the reports with the Fed’s January post-meeting statement, which read, “Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have remained low, and the unemployment rate has shown some signs of stabilization. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.”9
