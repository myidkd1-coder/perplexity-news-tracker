## Summary
Texas Children’s researchers identified 22 genes, many in immune system genes, that increase risk of chronic conditions after Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection by impairing viral control.

## Full Article
HOUSTON (February 2, 2026) – Texas Children’s researchers have helped identify 22 genes that increase the risk of developing a range of chronic conditions following a common viral infection.

Differences in these genes help explain why Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) can have lasting health effects in some people but not others. In a landmark study published in Nature, researchers analyzed genetic and health data from approximately 750,000 people across the UK and US.

EBV infects nearly everyone – around 90% of adults are infected – but typically remains silent in the body. For some however, this common virus can persist at higher levels and can contribute to serious chronic illnesses including lupus, chronic lung disease, heart disease, and certain cancers later in life – a mystery that has long challenged scientists.

This breakthrough work uses existing libraries of genomic and health data alongside novel computational methods to quantify EBV levels using existing genomic data across hundreds of thousands of individuals. The team discovered that certain genetic differences – many in immune system genes – could make it harder for the body to keep EBV under control. People with these variants are more likely to have higher levels of the virus in their blood, which is linked to increased rates of chronic disease.

While we cannot yet prevent EBV infection, this research points to how we can understand who may be most at risk for developing various chronic diseases, opening the door to earlier detection and intervention strategies.

“This research adds a missing piece to the puzzle of chronic disease. We show that genetic variation influences how well EBV is controlled, and that poorer viral control is associated with several long-term illnesses,” said Dr. Ryan Dhindsa, principal investigator at the Texas Children’s Duncan Neurological Research Institute (NRI) and assistant professor of pathology & immunology at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). “These findings suggest that health outcomes reflect a complex interaction between our genes, lifestyle, and viral history. While further work is needed to determine which of these links are causal, the results point to new ways to identify risk and guide future efforts to prevent and treat chronic disease.”

These findings build on a recent rapidly growing body of research validating links between EBV and chronic illness. By uncovering the gene-virus connection, this study sets the stage for a new wave of scientific discovery that prioritizes risk management and early intervention and accounts for the imprint that viruses we meet during our lifetime leave within us.

Together, the findings offer new insight into why some individuals face greater long-term health risks following common viral infections. For a list of all collaborators and funding, see the publication on the Nature website.
