The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is nearly over, and it’s setting the stage for a busy year in the technology space. Gadget manufacturers have started the year off with a bang in Las Vegas. But with pre-show events and press conferences kicking off even before the show officially did, our team has been knee-deep in new tech for what feels like much longer than one week.

You can scroll down through our liveblog below to get a recap of all that happened this week so far, but here’s a quick refresher. Monday (January 5) was press day, which saw many companies host press conferences to showcase their announcements. For example, Lego unveiled its new Smart Brick technology, and NVIDIA showed off its latest AI announcements for autonomous cars. Even before that, on Sunday night, Samsung held its First Look presentation, where it unveiled products across its home entertainment and appliance portfolios.

On Tuesday, the showfloor opened and we published our in-person impressions and thoughts of the new Pebble Round smartwatch and Index 01 AI ring. We waded through an endless parade of robots, including Dreame’s slightly terrifying robot vacuum concept and Lovense’s Emily “companion” doll. That evening, Lenovo held a press conference that saw NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan and AMD CEO Lisa Su take the same stage, alongside a mix of other notable names in tech (and elsewhere).
