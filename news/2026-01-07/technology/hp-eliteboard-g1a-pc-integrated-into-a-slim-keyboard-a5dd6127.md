(Image credit: Nvidia) If you're a deep diver in the world of gaming technology, you'll be interested to know that NVIDIA has announced the latest version of its incredible upscaling technology at CES 2026. The next DLSS 4.5 update will be available for free if you own a GTX 5000-series card, and it could silence complaints from gamers who claimed NVIDIA was skipping frames to maximize performance. Our Computing Editor Christian Guyton learned all about DLSS 4.5 in Las Vegas and he can tell you more.

A smaller-than-130-inch Samsung S90H TV at CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) CES 2026 is a big show, and that means it's a great time for big TVs! Samsung is breaking out one of its biggest television sets ever in this 130-inch RGB TV. Our Entertainment Editor Matt Bolton can barely see the top of this humongous thing! You can check out Samsung's big 130-inch panel on TechRadar's TikTok, along with all the other cool gadgets we've seen in Las Vegas.

The phone you'd make if your Threads handle was Captain2Phones (Image credit: Clicks) We get up mighty early here at TechRadar, so we've already compiled our CES 2026 Day 2 round-up, featuring 11 of the best gadgets we saw on our second day at the big show in Las Vegas. We've got cool new toys like the Lego Smart Brick, some retro turntables with amazing sound quality for vinyl enthusiasts, and... Wait... is that a BlackBerry phone?! Nope, but it's pretty close. Check out the Clicks Communicator, a real Android device that looks like a retro BlackBerry, launching at CES from our friends at Clicks. We're still going because the TechRadar CES party never stops!

The first Dolby Vision 2 sets from one of the biggest names in affordable home theater (Image credit: Future) Are you a fan of home theater? If so, you've probably been waiting anxiously for Dolby Vision 2 equipment to finally hit the market. We've got our eyes on Dolby's newest standard for TV's and video equipment, and here at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, we can even see Dolby Vision 2 in action on Hisense TVs. Hisense was long-rumored to be one of the first approved TV-makers to support Vision 2, but of course the sets had to actually go through the testing and approval process. We're hearing that some of the TVs that are with us live in Vegas have finally met with Dolby approval. Will we be able to buy them and install them before the next big game? We'll know soon.

There's always some new health testing kits at CES (Image credit: Eli Health) It's not all fun and games and walking robots at CES 2026, there are plenty of consumer health gadgets on display as well. The home testing market especially is always good for new innovations in Vegas. A few years back, we saw the first home urine analysis gear from Withings at CES. This year we're seeing the first home hormone testing kit. Health company Eli is launching its hormometer for all of your home hormone testing needs. It reads your saliva (and you need to produce quite the quantity) for testing, and you can read all about it - including hormone test results from our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff.

A vacuum robot that can walk? That's an idea with... potential Do you have stairs in your house and a healthy envy of vacuum robots? Do you wish that your vacuum could just kick stuff out of the way? Enter the Roborock Saros Rover vacuum, a robot vacuum with <checks notes> legs?! Seriously?! A robot vacuum with legs? Okay, this is one you just have to see to believe. In any case, weird CES is back in 2026, and we're live on the scene checking out all the coolest gadgets in Las Vegas. Check out the walking vacuum robot below, or at TikTok. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Confirmed: the first TV brands supporting Dolby Vision 2 (Image credit: Future) Some hot-off-the-press AV news for you – we've just heard which TV brands are going to support Dolby Vision 2, the next version of the popular HDR format. Announced at CES 2026, the big three (for now) are Hisense, TCL and Philips, which will all support Dolby Vision 2 in some of their upcoming sets this year. You can find out exactly which models in our story about Dolby's news. So what about the other big TV brands? Well, some are likely to announce support for the format later this year alongside their new sets – we can expect Sony to among those. Samsung, meanwhile, has never supported Dolby Vision. But the surprise missing name is LG, which has so far proved non-committal on the subject. Still, its new OLED TVs look pretty fantastic regardless...

HP just shoehorned a PC into a keyboard (Image credit: HP) Staying on the subject of convergence, HP has pulled out its shrink ray at CES 2026 and squeezed a Copilot+ PC into this pretty slimline keyboard. The EliteBoard G1a (product names have never been HP's thing) is only 12mm thick and weighs 750 grams, but manages to pack in an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series chip, built-in speakers and dual mics. Another tick is the user-replaceable 35Wh battery, and you can add a fingerprint sensor for biometric logins, too. Of course, this isn't the first PC-in-a-keyboard we've seen (if you're old like me, you'll remember Commodore Amigas in the 1980s), but it is an elegant bit of computing design. Unfortunately, we don't yet know how much that design will set you back when it lands in March 2026... (Image credit: HP)

The ultimate flashlight? Mark Wilson (TechRadar's news editor) taking over for the liveblog for a while here – and I've just spotted a gadget on our TikTok channel that's pure CES. The Timeli smart personal safety system (watch our hands-on below) is a cross between a flashlight and a personal GPS safety system. Alongside being blindingly bright, it has live GPS tracking, a loud alarm, and two-way voice communication with emergency dispatch. A satisfying red button also helps to trigger the latter. Is the Timeli completely unnecessary overkill, or a new essential for your off-grid adventures? I'll let you decide, but one thing that could sway you is the price – it'll be $299 when it lands in February, which gives you a year of free service, after which you'll pay $9.95 a month. There's no escaping those subscriptions in 2026, after all... @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Is AI getting a bit too serious for your liking? Do you wish you could just escape all of the AI news and developments? Do you need a drink? Good news! Here's a new AI bartender, ready to serve... booze. Our team in Las Vegas got a chance to check out this new AI robot that can make your favorite libations (or whatever it decides your favorite should be), and we walked away thirsty for more. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

When is a processor exciting? When it's a Snapdragon (Image credit: Qualcomm) Qualcomm shook up the laptop world with its first Snapdragon X chips, offering incredible battery life and top-notch performance at a lower price than Intel's iron. We've already seen the sequel in the Snapdragon X2 Elite high-performance chip, and at CES 2026 the chipmaker is showing off a more affordable version of its next-gen laptop chipset: the Snapdragon X2 Plus. The new X2 Plus chip offers fewer processor cores than the Snapdragon X2 Elite chip we already knew about, so this should be an even more affordable processor to pack ultrathin laptops and hybrid tablets running Windows. Our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff got hands-on with Qualcomm's reference design laptops housing the latest processor inside: @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

@techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Back to laptops now, and our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has gone hands on with the new Snapdragon X2 Plus, Qualcomm's new 3-nanometer AI chipset designed to bring ultra-powerful performance to everyone from business owners to gamers. Check out the video for more juicy details.

Talk to the band (Image credit: Luna) The latest fitness tracker debuting at CES presents a new alternative to clumsy interfaces on tiny screens. The Luna Band is a fitness tracker without a screen, like Whoop (without a subscription) or the new Polar Loop, and it's designed to be operated via voice. It specializes in “real-time, voice-led health guidance”, the idea being that you can log your meals, mood and emotions by speaking to the device, and view it all in the app at a later date. This is apparently done via Siri, but there's no word on Android compatibility. It sounds elegant: here's hoping it works in practice.

The Blackberry strikes back (Image credit: Clicks) Well, kind of. It's not strictly a Blackberry, but the Clicks Communicator shows, along with the Pebble Round 2, that people are getting fed up of their black mirrors and yearn to return to the days when gadgetry was all about fun, not data collection. With Android 16, the Google Play Store on tap, along with modern innovations like wireless charging and 256GB of internal storage, the Clicks Communicator is a Blackberry-style PDA with a physical keyboard fit for 2026. A single rear camera lens and a 3.5mm headphone jack shows it means business about being a stripped-back, retro comms device. Best of all, it's very affordable, with pre-orders from $399 (around £295 / AU$595).

(Image credit: Boston Dynamics) After many years of showcasing their humanoid robots get kicked, pushed and otherwise roughed up in many viral stress-test videos, Boston Dynamics is ready to enter the workforce with its Atlas humanoid in 2028. Designed for a factory environment, it boasts freedom of movement to help it find more efficient movement pathways than a human is capable of (we were mesmerized watching its joints swivel, both creepy and cool) along with self-battery replacement, the ability to lift up to 110 pounds, and even weatherproofing. It's starting its journey at the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Savannah, Georgia, and will probably be assembling cars by 2030. Read all about it here.

(Image credit: Future) "I got blue lips and weak knees on my first day at CES 2026" is a heck of a headline, so definitely check out our Editor-at-Large, Lance Ulanoff's recap of his first day at this year's CES, including a cutting-edge knife (pun intended), and a $20,000 robotic massage chair that "aggressively massaged my back and butt."

(Image credit: Samsung) Hi all, it's Matt Hanson taking over this live blog for a while! I've just written up a report on Samsung's latest laptops, which it launched at CES. I've been really impressed with Samsung's laptops recently, so I'm really keen to try out these new models, especially as they are powered by Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 3 processors, which are shaping up to be a real return to form.

We've tried Shokz' new open earbuds (Image credit: Future) Open earbuds have experienced massive growth over the past few years, and are now the listening device of choice for many runners, cyclists and sporty types in general. Shokz makes some of the best – so we were eager to go ears-on with its new OpenFit Pro. And the good news is that we very much like what we've heard so far. The big story here is that these are the first Shokz earbuds to feature a "synchronized dual-diaphragm driver and noise reduction" – which, for the layperson, means they offer a form of noise cancellation despite their open-ear design. Get the full details below… FULL STORY: I’ve worn the all-new Shokz open earbuds for 4 days and the ‘noise reduction’ is so good, I forget they’re open-ear

The new king of turntables? (Image credit: Audio-Technica) Nothing beats the warm sound of vinyl, whatever your music tastes – so the fact that Audio-Technica has launched a new turntable at CES 2026 is good news. The Audio-Technica AT-LP7X is the replacement for the esteemed AT-LP7, which has been around for years now and so probably was due an update. It's a fully manual belt-driven model that focuses more on audio fidelity than fancy gimmicks, and it will set you back £679 / €799 (about $920 / AU$1,369). FULL STORY: Audio-Technica just updated one of its best ever turntables at CES 2026, and I want it

Good morning and welcome to day 1 day 2 day 3 of CES 2026. Actually, I'm not really sure what day it is. Technically CES opens today, but the media day was yesterday and our coverage started fully on Sunday. Anyway, the key thing is that CES IS FULLY UNDERWAY and there are loads of massive stories coming out from it.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, from our hands-on live at CES 2026 (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) We're covering all the CES 2026 news here, but if you want to focus on just NVIDIA and its gaming and graphics card news (among its many endeavors), we'll be going live once Jensen Huang takes the stage for the NVIDIA CES Keynote at 9pm PT in Las Vegas. You can follow along at that attached link.

Watch LG TVs do magic tricks in Las Vegas You can't spell CES without TVs, and the biggest name in TVs - LG - has some big new sets on display in Las Vegas. We got to spend some time with these high-quality displays, including one of the thinnest TV's we've ever seen - a 'Wallpaper' OLED that you have to see to believe.

(Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol) It's not all fun and games at CES 2026, we've also seen some seriously powerful computing machines, including Samsung's new Galaxy Book 6. This huge, powerhouse laptop is built on Intel's latest chip architecture, and it can handle up to 30 hours of video playback. Check out the video below, and these laptops will be coming soon, though we don't know exactly when. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We round up the best gadgets of CES 2026 that we saw on day one! (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) It's only Day 1 of CES 2026, so how much could we have possibly seen? Enough to make a list of the 11 best gadgets we saw at CES already, with some seriously cool new, retro, and upcoming technology. Have you been curious about the revenant Pebble Watch? We got hands-on in Las Vegas. Want to see the famous Samsung Galaxy Trifold live and in the flex? We flexed it for you. How about an ultrasonic knife?! I'm not joking, it's in there. Check out our list of the coolest things we've seen, and keep reading because TechRadar never sleeps, so we'll have more cool gadgets when you check back.

(Image credit: Jacob Krol / Future) Lego sets and Lego building are huge right now, whether you build in person or tear things apart in Lego Star Wars. So, it's worth spending more time looking at the latest Lego innovation. Check out our first look at this Lego Smart Brick can do, live from CES in Las Vegas, where our editors are playing and getting hands-on with all the latest! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

The biggest Lego upgrade ever (Image credit: Jacob Krol / Future) We've gotten our first look at the new Lego Smart Brick, and you can check it out on our TechRadar TikTok! All of that technology packed into the size of a single small Lego brick, it truly is the future for smart toys and building blocks. Read all about the new Smart Brick and Lego Smart Play, the biggest Lego upgrade maybe ever! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Withings reveals its 'longevity station' (Image credit: Withings) I have to applaud Withings for dreaming up a more exciting name for smart scales at CES 2026. It's billing its new Body Scan 2 as a "longevity station", because it can apparently measure your current (and future) health with greater accuracy than before. That's because its smart scale – which includes a retractable handle – can now track over 60 biomarkers, including your body composition, artery health, hypertension risk and more. Actually, after spending two weeks eating chocolate and cheese, I'm not sure I want its 90-second "longevity assessment", but it certainly sounds like a new contender for our guide to the best smart scales (if you can stomach the $599 price tag, which converts to around £445 / AU$895).

Hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) Samsung's first tri-folding phone just made its US debut at CES 2026 – and TechRadar's Editor At Large has just spent some quality time with it. Our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold review has all the details, but the takeaway is that it's a "remarkable feat of engineering" that gives you "truly pocketable big-screen tablet productivity". Its 10-inch screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio also makes a lot of sense for watching movies on the move. The only question now is how much it'll cost – in Korea, it starts at 3.59 million KRW (about $2,500) but we still don't know its official global pricing.

Behold, the robots of CES 2026 (Image credit: SwitchBot) Hello, Mark Wilson (TechRadar's UK news editor) here and I'm taking over this liveblog for the next hour. For me, CES is mainly about robots. And you know, sensible things like Qi2 phone chargers. But mainly robots. And fortunately, we've already seen a couple of promising new ones make their debuts in Las Vegas. Hot on the heels of the laundry-folding heels of the SwitchBot Onero H1 (above) is the LG CLOiD humanoid robot. Yes, it takes 45 seconds to put a wet towel into a washing machine, but one day (maybe CES 2046) that'll be down to five seconds and we'll be living in laundry dreamland. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Another exciting AI-powered gadget from the show floor is Nosh, a robot chef that uses AI to select ingredients, prep and make a meal. With 500 recipes onboard spanning various cultures, cuisines and even beverages, there's a lot to love about this home assistant, especially for those with accessibility needs. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Let's briefly head back to Lance on the show floor, where he's been trying out Fraimic, a new e-ink photo frame that creates bespoke artwork for your walls. With the power of voice prompts, WhisperAI and ChatGPT, this makes for a fun addition to your home. Just be careful you don't accidentally prompt the creation of some Eldrich horror while you're chatting about Hallowe'en plans at home. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Soundcore) "Only 5 days in, the best fitness headphones of 2026 have already been announced" – bold claims from one of our regular contributors, Tom Bedford, as he's got his sights set on Anker's new kind-of-sort-of open earbuds. So what's the source of the ambiguity? Well, the Aerofit 2 Pro are hybrid headphones with different modes that adjust the depth of the earbud itself extends into your ear, meaning you can benefit from both ANC and open ear audio.

What's that? Why, it's an itty-bitty teeny-weeny mini action camerini! DJI has some competition from newcomer Leaptic, a brand releasing a new kind of tiny action cam at CES. It's strikingly similar in design to the Osmo Nano, but otherwise we don't know much, only that it will shoot video at a higher 8K resolution and weighs just 35g. Stay tuned for more news this week!

Hot off the press! We've shared our first impression of Samsung's new Galaxy Z Trifold phone, and it's a doozy. Naturally, we're impressed by its thinness and screen real estate, but time will tell how performance, battery and user experience will factor in to this incredible feat of design. We've thus far only spent a few minutes with the device, so hold your horses if you're expecting a full review; that'll come in time.

(Image credit: Amazon) Josie here now to fill you in on the latest CES news. Oh, looks like Samsung’s The Frame and LG W6 'Wallpaper' have some competition in the discrete screen category, with Amazon announcing the Amazon Ember Artline, a 4K QLED TV with support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision finished with a matte coating to block reflections on the screen and ultimately reduce glare. At just 1.5 inches, it's impressively thin, and comes with over 2,000 pre-loaded artworks to spruce up your home — or you can connect it to your Amazon Photos to choose from your favorite shots. Better yet, if you're spoiled for choice, Amazon's AI has the power to help you; simply share four pictures of where the Ember Artline is hung and it'll analyze the space to recommend photos or artworks that match your decor. It also features Amazon’s Omnisense Technology for intelligent screen activation when you enter (or leave) a room.

(Image credit: Future) Straight from the halls of CES 2026 comes this report from our TV expert Al Griffin, who has seen TCL's next-generation SQD mini-LED TV, which the firm is hyping up as the 'best TV in the market.' As Al explains, SQD stands for Super Quantum Dots, and the tech alongside TCL's Deep Color System should make for some very impressive images, and will look particularly good in large TVs. That's good to hear, as the TCL X11L SQD mini-LED TV will go on sale later this month in 98 and 85-inch screens, with a 75-incher coming later.

(Image credit: Future) At CES 2026 we're trying something new: a live Q&A that allows you to ask our team of experts who are on the ground in Las Vegas about what new and exciting gadgets they're seeing. All you need to do is sign in or sign up (it's free!) to our commenting system, then post your questions and one of the team will answer it. Seen a cool-looking TV you want to know more about? Fancy the look of a laptop but want to know more about the specs? Then this is your chance to ask us directly. We'll try to get back to every question as soon as possible, though due to time zone differences and inevitable Wi-Fi wonkiness, there might be a bit of a delay, but hopefully we'll keep that to a minimum.

(Image credit: Govee) CES is a great show for smart home products, and Govee has just announced some great new smart lights, and we have all the information you need. I particularly like the look of the Ceiling Light Ultra, which comes with a 616-pixel LED matrix that can show animated scenes, though I'm slightly concerned that the price will be very expensive. Hopefully we'll get pricing information soon as well. (Image credit: Govee)

It's Matt again (you'll probably see a few of us take turns on this blog), and my colleague John Loeffler is at CES 2026 helping to cover all the computing news that will come out of the huge tech show. As with previous years, we'll be hearing from some of the biggest brands in computing, including Asus, Acer, Nvidia and Intel. (Image credit: Getty Images / Moor Studio) Before that, however, what is John looking forward to seeing at this year's show? Well, you can read his early hopes, which include wanting to see AI (artificial intelligence) features that are actually impressive. Like John, I've so far not been too impressed with AI, despite many companies promising that it will revolutionise our gadgets - and our lives. Hopefully, CES 2026 changes that, as there's no doubt there'll be plenty of talk about AI at Las Vegas this year.

It's not all big-ticket tech at CES – our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has had his hands on a new digital fidget toy with clickable buttons and a collection of pre-installed games. You also get the fun of building it, because it comes as a little kit to keep your hands busy. Check it out! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Samsung Display) Hi there! Homes editor Cat Ellis here, taking over the live blog for a moment to bring you some interesting musings on the latest developments in TV tech. We've seen some very exciting new screens at CES, but our writer Carrie Marshall thinks the latest panels might not be all they seem. New TVs from LG and Samsung promise up to 4,500 nits at peak brightness, but Carrie points out that those results would have been achieved in very specific controlled conditions, so you're not likely to need shades to watch The Night Manager any time soon.

Lance, our Editor-at-Large, is at CES in Las Vegas, and he's been posting some great videos of all the cool gadgets he's seen so far on our TikTok channel. This has led to a nice jump-scare this morning for me as I scrolled our live blog and saw a video of Lance waving a knife around. For a slightly less concerning video, here's Lance testing out what at first looks like one of Tony Stark's prototypes, but is actually a massage chair. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Apple) Morning everyone, it's Matt Hanson, Managing Editor of Core Tech, and I'll be covering CES announcements here for an hour or so. Like my boss, Marc, I am not in warm Las Vegas, but in chilly and slightly snowy Bath, UK, and the image above is an accurate depiction of how I am dressed today. Fraggle-chic, I call it.

Meet the LG C6H… (Image credit: Future) Many of the big announcements so far have been around TVs, with Samsung and LG's efforts in particular standing out. Let's start with LG – because it's making a big change for its almost-flagship 'C' series OLED for 2026, with the C6 coming in not one but two versions. Yes, that's right: you'll be able to buy either the standard C6, or the new C6H model, with the latter using a fancy Primary RGB Tandem panel, as seen in last year's flagship G5 set. This should make for better brightness and color – with the downside being that it'll only be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes. You can get more detail on the new LG C6 and C6H here, and stay tuned for further updates as we get them.

Good morning from the UK. Marc McLaren here, taking over for a post or two – but from cold, snowy London, not warm, sunny Las Vegas.

Beyond the massive TVs – looking at you, Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV – we spotted a unique take on a classic kitchen gadget at CES Unveiled. What looks like a standard knife for cutting vegetables actually uses microvibrations to make slicing and dicing much easier. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We saw the Pebble Round 2 (Image credit: Core Devices) Thanks to a suprise announcement last week, we knew we'd get the chance to see the Pebble Round 2 at CES, and our first look at the new smartwatch has arrived on TechRadar's TikTok. Now back to life thanks to Core Devices, the Pebble Round 2 is boasting an edge-to-edge, round color e-paper display and promises one week of battery life. That's a big difference compared to the other leading smartwatches, and the Round 2 arrives a decade after the previous Round watch hit the market. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Here's one peek behind the scenes, and I bet you'll see it trending on TikTok from folks visiting Samsung's space at The Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas for CES 2026. They set up a sort of tunnel within a ballroom filled with speakers and numerous projectors to change the environment and, at times, immerse you in color. It's really neat and got folks talking before they even saw all the new TVs and other gadgets. I especially like the mirror entrances at the front and back, which give the illusion that this goes on for miles.

Samsung stuns with new TVS – OLED, Frame, and Micro RGB included Samsung's First Look might be wrapped, but TechRadar is the place to be, thanks to our team of experts breaking down all that was unveiled. And the star of the show is a new concept, but one that we viewed with our own eyes – Samsung's new 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It not only stretches farther than the 115-inch model Samsung's been selling since last year, but it can also be wall-mounted or sat on a pretty incredible stand. (Image credit: Future) Similarly, the major-sized 98-inch standard Frame TV ... might well just be the TV of my dreams. Though I'm a bit scared for the eventual price reveal. Meanwhile, Samsung also made some updates to its lineup of OLED TVs. Yes, even with the arrival of Micro RGB TVs in various sizes, Samsung's still offering QLED, Neo QLED, and OLED. Notably, the flagship OLED is brighter, includes a metal stand, and will display works of art via Art Mode. Samsung reveals upgraded OLED TVs and super-sized screens at CES 2026

We'll have more from CES Unveiled shortly, but Samsung's big First Look 2025 event is about to kick off. Given that the tech giant isn't doing a formal keynote this year, this will be Samsung's big presentation. Historically, this has been the place for Samsung to unveil new TVs, home audio, and monitors, but in more recent years, it's all also been about AI, AI, and more AI. Samsung's already teased and even pre-announced some key things – including an expansion of its microRGB lineup – so it'll likely be a full presentation.
