Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay on Thursday said the AI Impact Summit being hosted in India carries “global importance” and not just significance for the Global South, describing India as a rapidly emerging centre of technological growth and the artificial intelligence revolution.



Speaking to ANI, he said, "I'm delighted to be in India to take part in the AI Impact Summit. You may say this is the first summit to be held in the global south. This is what I've heard from several people: that this is the first time that the AI summit is being held in the global south. Yeah, that is true, but more than the global south, the AI summit being held in India really has global importance, not just the global south."



He added that India was "quickly becoming the centre of technological growth and the AI revolution".



Expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tobgay said he was "deeply grateful" for the invitation to participate in the summit. Highlighting the long-standing ties between India and Bhutan, he said the two countries have enjoyed "very close and successful cooperation" across sectors, particularly in renewable energy, noting, "For decades, India and Bhutan have worked very closely, and we have enjoyed the support of the Indian government to develop our hydropower."



Looking ahead, Tobgay outlined potential collaboration linking clean energy and emerging technologies, saying, "Going forward, I see partnerships in two related areas: one, enhancing the development of our partnership to harness our fast-flowing rivers to generate clean green renewable energy and two, using this clean green renewable energy in Bhutan, in the Gelephu Mindfulness City, to achieve our common objectives in terms of artificial intelligence."



He added that such cooperation would further strengthen India-Bhutan ties while contributing to sustainable technological development in the region. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held talks with Tobgay on the sidelines of the India AI Impact Summit 2026 in New Delhi.
