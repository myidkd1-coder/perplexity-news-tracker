Top News Headlines of January 18, 2026 | In the first Republic Day parade after Operation Sindoor, India will showcase its military might, including its newly-raised Bhairav light commando battalion and a range of indigenous platforms, in a phased battle array format. This will be the first time that the public will get to see military assets in the sequence they would appear during actual combat. According to a statement, the Ministry of Defence said the Indian Army will be represented by a mounted column of 61 Cavalry and battle array formation.

Meanwhile, the Faridabad-based Al Falah University, under the scanner of probe agencies after its three doctors were identified as suspects in the November 10, 2025 explosion outside the Red Fort, hired doctors prior to inspection and showed them as regular doctors on rolls to mislead the National Medical Commission (NMC), got intermediaries to arrange patients and hurriedly set up clinical facilities before the inspection. These are some of the claims of the Enforcement Directorate which is probing the Al Falah Charitable Trust linked to the University.
