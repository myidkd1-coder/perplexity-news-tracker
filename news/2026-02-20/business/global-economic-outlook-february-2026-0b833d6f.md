## Summary
S&P Global raises global GDP growth forecast to 2.9% for 2026, with higher projections for US and India; January PMI data shows pick-up in growth momentum despite geopolitical concerns.

## Full Article
Geopolitical events and related uncertainties have contributed to choppy commodity and financial markets, but S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs®) point to relatively resilient economic conditions.

At around $68 per barrel at the time of writing, the price of Dated Brent crude oil is below its peak year-to-date, but still more than 10% above its end-2025 level, amid ongoing concerns about potential disruption to Middle Eastern supply. Prices of precious metals are below their January record highs, but remain very elevated.

US equity markets have come under pressure, with the S&P 500 recording back-to-back weekly losses in the first half of February. The tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index has continued its recent underperformance, losing ground for five straight weeks. The US Treasury market has benefited from a related ‘flight to safety,’ with 10-year yields falling to their lowest level since November. Narrowing yield differentials are forecast to continue to lean down on the US dollar.
