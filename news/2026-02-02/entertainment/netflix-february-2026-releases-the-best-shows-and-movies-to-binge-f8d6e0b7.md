## Full Article
Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder steps into the spotlight for a cause close to his heart. This documentary follows a benefit concert created to raise awareness for a rare skin condition. The film centers on a Seattle benefit concert and highlights stories from families, doctors, and researchers. There is music, emotion, and purpose. It is quiet in places and powerful in others. A good pick if you want something meaningful and not too cerebral.
