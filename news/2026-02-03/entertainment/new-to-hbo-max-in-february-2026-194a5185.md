## Full Article
February arrives with a heavy rotation of fresh originals, returning favorites, and a deep catalog refresh that makes HBO Max feel especially stacked this month. With winter still in full swing, the service leans into intense dramas, buzzy new series, and comfort rewatches that invite long nights on the couch.

What’s Worth Watching on HBO Max This February

The biggest conversation starter is Neighbors, a new A24 backed series from Josh Safdie that turns everyday disputes into something far more unsettling, per Tomsguide. The show zooms in on petty disagreements that spiral into emotional warfare, leaning on dark humor and raw tension rather than flashy twists. It feels intimate, uncomfortable, and very much in line with Safdie’s knack for finding chaos in ordinary lives.

Another standout arrives later in the month with Portobello, a dramatic retelling of the real life downfall of Italian television star Enzo Tortora. The series revisits how accusations tied to organized crime dismantled his career and reputation almost overnight. Instead of rushing to judgment, the show carefully unpacks media pressure, legal failures, and the personal toll of public disgrace.

Movie fans get a chilling new option with Dead of Winter, a thriller that thrives on isolation. Set during a brutal blizzard, the story traps a grieving widow inside her home alongside a kidnapped young woman and the couple responsible for her captivity. The film relies more on atmosphere and moral tension than nonstop action, making it a fitting cold weather watch.

Whether you’re looking for prestige drama, nostalgic rewatches, or something unsettling to match the winter mood, HBO Max’s February lineup covers just about every lane.
