India witnessed a series of high-profile events in 2025 that dominated national headlines. From a major terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir and India’s calibrated military response against Pakistan to a stampede, an aviation tragedy, severe air pollution and one-sided election results, each development drew public attention.Here is a rundown of the key events that defined the year 2025.The Prayagraj Maha Kumbh Mela, held in January and February, drew tens of millions of pilgrims during the month-long congregation. On January 29, during Mauni Amavasya, a crowd crush occurred near one of the main bathing ghats as devotees surged forward amid congestion and restricted movement corridors. State authorities confirmed dozens of fatalities and multiple injuries.The Uttar Pradesh government ordered a judicial inquiry, suspended officials responsible for crowd management in the affected sector, and revised deployment plans for police and disaster response teams.On February 15, a crowd crush at the New Delhi railway station resulted in 18 deaths and several injuries as passengers converged on platforms amid heavy rush linked to the Kumbh Mela and regular intercity services. The incident occurred during peak evening hours, triggering panic on foot overbridges and access points.On April 22, terrorists opened fire on tourists in the Baisaran Valley near Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir, killing 26 civilians, including newlyweds. The attack triggered large-scale security operations across South Kashmir. The intelligence inputs pointed towards Pakistan-based terror networks.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) later filed a chargesheet naming Pakistani nationals and operatives of Lashkar-e-Taiba and its proxy, The Resistance Front (TRF), citing digital evidence, financial trails, and reconnaissance inputs. The Cabinet Committee on Security subsequently approved diplomatic and security measures, including heightened border vigilance and suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.Following the attack, India launched Operation Sindoor, a limited military operation targeting terror infrastructure across the Line of Control (LoC), based on what officials described as "specific and credible intelligence inputs". The five-day conflict, between May 6 and May 10, 2025, ended after Pakistan requested a ceasefire.The Ministry of Defence said the action aimed to "neutralise launchpads and support structures used for cross-border terrorism" and was conducted in a "focused, measured and non-escalatory manner". Government officials said the strikes were executed within a narrow operational window to minimise collateral damage.On June 12, Air India Flight 171 crashed shortly after take-off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, Ahmedabad, killing 241 passengers and crew and 19 people on the ground, according to official casualty figures.Preliminary analysis of flight data and cockpit voice recorders indicated a sudden loss of engine thrust during take-off, prompting scrutiny of engine systems, fuel supply, crew actions, maintenance records, and weather conditions. Interim safety advisories were issued pending the final report.Stampedes at separate crowded events in Karur and Bengaluru left several people dead and many others injured, prompting authorities in both states to order inquiries into the incidents.In Karur, a political rally on September 27 turned deadly after a sudden surge in the crowd, with officials citing overcrowding, inadequate barricading and poor access management as contributing factors. The Tamil Nadu government ordered a magisterial inquiry, announced ex- gratia compensation for victims’ families and issued fresh crowd-control guidelines.In Bengaluru, panic broke out at a heavily attended event, leading to a stampede that killed and injured multiple people, with officials flagging crowd mismanagement and safety lapses; emergency services were rushed to the spot and a probe was ordered to fix responsibility.On November 10, a car explosion near Gate No. 1 of the Red Fort and the Lal Quila Metro Station in central Delhi killed at least 12 people. It injured around 20 others, prompting a high-security alert across the capital.The blast happened amid nationwide raids by investigating agencies in Jammu, Faridabad and Rajasthan, where thousands of kilos of explosives were found. Intelligence agencies revealed the deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort was not an isolated incident, but part of a larger terror conspiracy involving planned serial explosions in multiple locations.Investigators found that suspects had planned to ready 32 vehicles with explosives for coordinated attacks in several cities.Probe details indicated that suspects intended serial blasts across four cities, including places such as Ayodhya and Prayagraj.Two assembly elections held in 2025 were largely one-sided contests where the BJP emerged as the clear winner against Congress and its alliance. In Delhi, BJP emerged as the largest party, winning 48 out of 70 seats in the assembly. Outgoing Kejriwal-led AAP won just 22 seats, marking a return ofthe Saffron party after several decades in India's political capital. Rekha Gupta was sworn in as the Chief Minister.In the Bihar Assembly elections held in November, the NDA emerged victorious, securing 202 of 243 seats. Nitish Kumar became Chief Minister for a record 10th term. The opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan was reduced to 35 seats.During December, air quality across Delhi and the National Capital Region deteriorated sharply, with multiple monitoring stations recording "severe" and "abysmal" levels. On December 15, AQI readings approached 500, the index's upper limit.Dense smog disrupted daily life, reduced visibility, and caused flight delays and rail disruptions. Authorities activated Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), imposing restrictions on older diesel vehicles, suspending most construction activity, and advising staggered office timings and remote work.In early December, IndiGo, India's largest airline by market share, faced a major operational crisis, with widespread flight cancellations and delays that stranded tens of thousands of passengers.From December 2, disruptions were driven by a shortage of available pilots and crew following the enforcement of new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules mandating more extended rest periods and stricter duty caps, coinciding with peak winter travel and dense fog.The situation peaked on December 5, when over 1,600 flights were cancelled in a single day, affecting major hubs including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.The DGCA issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo's CEO, ordered a cut of up to 10% in the airline's winter schedule, and pressed for passenger refunds and support. The Ministry of Civil Aviation capped fares on key routes, while the Competition Commission of India initiated a preliminary review.Apologising for the large-scale disruption, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers announced that affected passengers were eligible for refunds or rebooking under DGCA norms.
