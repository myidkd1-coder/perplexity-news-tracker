## Summary
White House factsheet on India-US trade deal clarifies terms, including zero tariffs linked to no Russian oil imports, as part of ongoing bilateral trade updates.

## Full Article
The White House has released a detailed fact sheet following the signing of a landmark India–U.S. trade framework, calling it a major step toward balanced and reciprocal trade between the two strategic partners. Under the agreement, India will slash or eliminate tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and a wide range of American agricultural and food products, while committing to purchase over 500 billion dollars’ worth of U.S. energy, technology, agricultural and coal products. The deal also targets non-tariff barriers, sets rules of origin, removes India’s digital services tax, and deepens cooperation on digital trade, supply chains, and technology. The Trump administration says the framework strengthens economic and national security, boosts market access for American exporters, and challenges decades of what it calls unfair trade practices. Experts believe the agreement could significantly lift India’s exports in the coming years as tariffs fall and trade flows expand.
