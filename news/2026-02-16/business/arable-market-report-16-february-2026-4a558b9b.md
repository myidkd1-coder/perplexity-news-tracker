## Summary
This week's grain and oilseed market update covers UK and global activity, with optimism for 2026 crops. IKAR raised Russian wheat forecast to 91.0 Mt; FranceAgriMer notes best French wheat conditions since 2023. Higher US maize exports and China's imports support prices; USDA Outlook Forum upcoming.

## Full Article
European wheat futures again recorded small changes Friday–Friday, amid high global supplies and ongoing export challenges. Some signs of higher demand for maize helped prevent losses, while re-positioning by speculative traders boosted US prices.

May-26 Paris milling wheat futures gained 0.5% over the week, while May-26 Chicago maize futures gained 0.7%, with wheat up 1.8%.

Global wheat prices fell ahead of Tuesday night’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates from the USDA. The USDA reduced its forecasts for global wheat and maize stocks by 0.7 Mt and 1.9 Mt, respectively. While the cuts were more than the market had expected, stocks are still forecast much higher than last season.

Reflecting ongoing intense competition for global exports, Expana cut its forecast for EU-27 soft wheat exports this season by 1.2 Mt to 27.6 Mt. The resulting higher end-of-season stocks more than offset a 0.3 Mt reduction to its 2026 EU crop forecast to 128.3 Mt because of recent cold weather, which could boost 2026/27 supplies.

There was also optimism for some 2026 crops.

IKAR added 3.0 Mt to its forecast of the Russian wheat crop, now at 91.0 Mt versus 88.5 Mt in 2025. FranceAgriMer also reported French soft winter wheat crops to be in the best condition since 2023, and spring barley planting ahead of average at 30% complete. This week’s USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum (19–20 Feb) may provide insights into US crop potential.

Prices found some support later in the week from signs of higher global demand. US net export sales of maize in the week ending 5 February were 2.13 Mt, exceeding expectations of 0.6–1.5 Mt. Reuters also reported that poorer maize crop quality in China is prompting higher imports of barley and sorghum.

South American maize remains a watch point. The rain forecast for Argentina would be very welcome for its later-planted maize crops, which are in reproductive stages. Meanwhile, Conab reduced its forecast of Brazil’s second maize crop by 1.2 Mt to 109.26 Mt due to a lower planted area. The crop is now forecast 3.5% below 2024/25.

Planting has been progressing well but depends on soyabean harvest progress.
