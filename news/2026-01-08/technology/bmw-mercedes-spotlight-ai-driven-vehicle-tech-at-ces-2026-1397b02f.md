At this year’s CES technology conference in Las Vegas, Mercedes and BMW unveiled new artificial intelligence-driven features and EV technology as software and digital experiences play a larger role in vehicle development.

BMW revealed that the updated assistant will roll out in Germany and the U.S. starting in the second half of 2026, beginning with the BMW iX3. The automaker also noted it will be the first to integrate the Alexa+ technology into its vehicles. The updated assistant uses a large language model to enable more natural conversations, multi-question voice commands, and predictive responses. Users will be able to link Amazon accounts to stream music, access news, and use other services.

The technology is central to BMW’s Neue Klasse generation of EVs, which the automaker has repeatedly highlighted at CES.

On the other hand, Mercedes featured the GLC and showcased its MBUX Hyperscreen, immersive spatial audio, and intelligent air suspension. The automaker said the vehicle features the first in-car infotainment system to integrate AI from both Microsoft and Google within its fourth-generation MBUX platform.

Additionally, Mercedes displayed its new CLA with AI-powered automated driving technology. Developed with Nvidia, the MB.Drive Assist Pro platform provides advanced Level 2 driver assistance capable of navigating city streets.

As automakers increasingly emphasize software-defined vehicles, AI integration, and connected experiences, CES 2026 highlights how AI, cloud computing, and software consolidation are reshaping vehicle development timelines and in-car experiences across the industry.
