## Full Article
Executive Vice-President for Technological Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, Henna Virkkunen will endorse the declaration on behalf of the EU, reaffirming the EU's commitment to strengthening its partnership with India, promoting AI innovation and international cooperation, and strengthening global AI governance.

In India, Executive Vice-President Virkkunen launched several important initiatives, including the European Legal Gateway Office with India's Minister of External Affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. Announced by President Ursula von der Leyen at the 16th EU–India Summit, the initiative aims to connect European companies with India's ICT talent base. The Executive Vice-President also launched the Frontier AI Grand Challenge, an EU-wide flagship competition to drive the development of sovereign, large-scale European AI models.

During the summit, the Commission also launched two calls for expression of interest as part of the Commission's Apply AI Strategy to strengthen European capabilities in AI. The first call invites healthcare organisations across Europe to join the network of AI-powered advanced screening centres, aiming to advance the safe and effective use of AI in cancer and cardiovascular prevention, early detection and diagnosis. The second call invites European AI actors to participate in an expert forum on frontier AI, which will map existing efforts in frontier AI in the EU and identify related opportunities and challenges.

The European Legal Gateway Office in India will increase the attractiveness of the European Union for talent; new calls and grand challenges will strengthen European capabilities in AI.”
