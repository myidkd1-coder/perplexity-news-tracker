EU Moves to Force Google to Share AI and Search Data Under New Tech Rules

EU regulators opened formal proceedings to spell out how Google must comply with the Digital Markets Act, with an emphasis on data access and interoperability. The focus is twofold: ensuring rivals can access key AI-related services and features (including Google’s Gemini capabilities), and clarifying how competitors can gain fair access to certain anonymized Google Search data used for ranking and performance insights.

For startups and smaller AI players, the stakes are huge. In AI, distribution and data access often matter as much as model quality. If regulators succeed in widening access to core services and datasets, it could lower barriers for challengers building search, assistants, and vertical AI products across Europe.

Google pushed back, warning that mandated sharing could create privacy risks and reduce incentives to innovate. The EU’s position is that DMA compliance is about preventing gatekeeper advantages from becoming permanent, especially as AI services become tightly coupled with platforms like search and Android.

Why It Matters: The DMA’s next phase could reshape Europe’s AI and search competition by making data access a regulatory requirement rather than a business concession.

Big Tech’s AI Spend Faces a Reality Check as Earnings Arrive

This week’s earnings from major tech companies are landing with a sharper investor question: how quickly does AI infrastructure turn into measurable revenue and margin expansion? Analysts are watching cloud growth, AI product monetization, and capex guidance as hyperscalers pour more money into chips, data centers, and talent.

The tension is straightforward. AI is expensive to scale, and the costs show up immediately in capex and operating expenses. The upside, however, is still unevenly distributed: some companies can bundle AI into existing products and pricing power, while others are still funding the build-out without clear unit economics.

Investors also want to know whether AI tailwinds are broad-based or concentrated. A strong earnings season could reinforce the idea that the “AI trade” remains intact. Weak signals of monetization could trigger more scrutiny of spending plans, especially for firms signaling aggressive 2026 infrastructure ramps.

Why It Matters: Earnings will help decide whether AI investment stays a growth narrative or becomes a margin and discipline story.

Axios: “Show Me the AI Money” Moment Hits Tech Markets

A new market narrative is forming around AI: investors are shifting from pure excitement about capabilities to proof of monetization. Axios framed this as a pivotal earnings stretch for mega-cap tech, with results expected to influence market leadership and sentiment across 2026.

What’s changed is the yardstick. In 2024 and 2025, the market rewarded companies for being early and loud about AI. Now the market wants clarity on where AI shows up in revenue. That includes pricing upgrades, ad conversion lift, higher cloud consumption, enterprise adoption metrics, and customer retention tied to AI features.

The broader implication for startups is the allocation of capital. If public markets punish AI spending without returns, late-stage private fundraising can tighten, valuation expectations can reset, and “growth at all costs” becomes harder to sustain even for well-positioned AI infrastructure providers.

Why It Matters: As Big Tech is forced to prove ROI, the ripple effects will shape venture funding sentiment and startup exit paths.

India’s “Techno-Legal” AI Governance Plan Signals a New Regulatory Model

India is advancing a governance approach that blends policy, institutional oversight, and implementation mechanisms across the AI lifecycle. A key proposal is a centralized governance group to coordinate ministries and regulators, plus structures for evaluation, testing, and feedback as AI deployment scales.

One notable element is the idea of a national AI incident database, designed to capture failures and harms and feed lessons back into standards and oversight. This resembles how mature industries treat safety: not as a one-time compliance check, but as continuous monitoring and learning.

India also ties governance to its digital public infrastructure, emphasizing identity, consent, auditability, and interoperability. For founders, this signals both opportunity and constraint: India’s large market could be a strong proving ground for AI at scale, but governance expectations may become more explicit, especially for consumer-facing systems and public services.

Why It Matters: India is shaping an AI rulebook built for scale, and it may influence how other high-growth markets govern AI risk.

SHEIN Appears Before European Parliament as EU Tightens Oversight of Online Platforms

European Parliament committee materials indicate SHEIN is appearing before lawmakers amid heightened scrutiny of online marketplaces and platform compliance. The focus includes product safety, consumer protection, and how platforms handle illegal or unsafe goods at scale.

For the tech ecosystem, this matters because enforcement pressure increasingly targets operational systems: supply-chain verification, seller onboarding, listing moderation, and cross-border logistics accountability. The EU isn’t just debating principles; it is putting specific platforms under the microscope to test whether rules can be applied in practice. For startups, it’s a signal about where demand is headed. Compliance tooling, verification tech, logistics transparency, and automated product-risk detection are becoming core infrastructure for commerce. Companies that can help platforms prove compliance without slowing growth stand to gain as enforcement rises.

Why It Matters: Platform regulation is shifting from policy talk to hearings and enforcement, creating demand for compliance and trust infrastructure.

Microsoft Office Zero-Day: New Exploitation Reports Raise Enterprise Security Pressure

Security researchers are tracking active exploitation of a Microsoft Office zero-day, a recurring pattern that continues to put IT teams in a race against attackers. When Office vulnerabilities get weaponized, the blast radius can be large because Office remains deeply embedded across enterprises and governments.

The key issue isn’t only the vulnerability itself; it’s the speed of operational response. Many organizations struggle to patch quickly due to compatibility concerns, user workflows, and complex endpoint fleets. Attackers take advantage of these delays, often chaining Office exploits with credential theft and lateral movement to reach higher-value systems.

For startups, incidents like this shape procurement. Security budgets increasingly prioritize prevention and rapid containment: hardening endpoints, restricting risky macros and file types, improving telemetry, and deploying controls that can stop exploit chains rather than single vulnerabilities.

Why It Matters: Office exploit waves keep endpoint defense and patch velocity at the top of enterprise buying priorities.

Okta-Linked Voice Phishing Wave Highlights a New Social Engineering Playbook

A cybercrime group has claimed credit for voice phishing operations, with reporting pointing back to a broader social engineering campaign tied to custom phishing kits. Voice-based attacks are gaining ground because they exploit human trust and can bypass controls built mainly for email threats.

The operational lesson is uncomfortable: even strong identity systems can be undermined if employees are manipulated into granting access or resetting credentials. The line between “technical breach” and “human breach” continues to blur, and attackers are professionalizing their scripts, tooling, and targeting.

For the startup ecosystem, this amplifies demand for identity hardening, secure workflows for resets, phishing-resistant authentication, and training that matches modern attacker tactics. Vendors that can reduce reliance on help-desk overrides and enforce verified identity proofing will be in a stronger position as voice threats become routine.

Why It Matters: Voice phishing is scaling because it attacks the human layer that many security stacks still can’t fully automate.

TikTok Service Disruption Spreads Across the US and Europe

TikTok experienced a major outage affecting users worldwide, with reports of widespread access and functionality issues. For consumer platforms operating at massive scale, outages become instant stress tests of infrastructure resilience, incident response, and communications discipline.

The business implications go beyond inconvenience. Creators, brands, and small businesses increasingly treat TikTok as a primary distribution channel. Disruptions can interrupt live campaigns, cut conversion during key shopping windows, and trigger short-term shifts in ad performance that spill into budgets across the broader social media market.

For startups building creator tooling, analytics, or commerce layers on top of social platforms, outages are a reminder of the risk of platform dependency. It pushes more founders to diversify integrations, support multi-platform publishing, and build fallback strategies that keep customers operating when a core channel goes down.

Why It Matters: Platform outages now have a direct economic impact on creators and SMBs that rely on social distribution as infrastructure.

Pace Raises $10M to Bring AI Into Insurance Workflows

Pace raised $10 million in funding, with Sequoia’s involvement and a thesis centered on applying enterprise AI inside insurance, a sector known for complex, document-heavy workflows and slow operational cycles.

Insurance is a high-value target for automation because it mixes regulated decision-making with large volumes of claims, policies, underwriting inputs, and customer communications. AI systems that can reduce cycle time, improve accuracy, and standardize process controls can create a real margin impact. But the bar is high: explainability, auditability, and error handling matter more than flashy demos.

For the broader startup landscape, this is part of a continuing shift: investors funding AI that plugs into enterprise “money flows” rather than generic productivity. The winners will be companies that can show measurable improvements in throughput, loss ratios, and customer retention, not just automation promises.

Why It Matters: Insurance is a massive, highly regulated back-office, and targeted AI plays can unlock real economic value if they meet compliance requirements.

SpotDraft Adds Qualcomm Backing for On-Device Legal AI

India-based SpotDraft raised $8 million in an extended Series B round, with the pitch emphasizing privacy-first, on-device AI for contract workflows. The theme is gaining traction as enterprises want AI help without pushing sensitive documents into external systems.

Legal and procurement teams are overloaded with repetitive review, approvals, redlining, and compliance checks. AI can streamline this work, but it introduces risk if confidential agreements are transmitted and stored in ways that create new exposure. On-device, tightly controlled deployment models aim to address this by keeping more processing closer to the user or within trusted infrastructure boundaries.

For the broader ecosystem, this highlights a practical direction for enterprise AI: smaller, purpose-built systems that integrate with workflows and meet privacy constraints. It’s also a reminder that hardware-aligned AI (optimized for specific chips) is becoming part of the enterprise product story, not just a mobile feature.

Why It Matters: Enterprise AI is shifting toward privacy and deployment control, and on-device approaches could become a differentiator in regulated workflows.

Researchers Detail a New “Data-Pilfering” Attack Targeting Chatbots

Researchers are warning about a class of “data-pilfering” attacks that can trick AI chatbots into revealing sensitive information under certain conditions. The concern isn’t just theoretical: as more companies embed assistants into internal tools and knowledge bases, the risk of leaking private data grows if access controls, prompt handling, and retrieval systems aren’t designed defensively.

The attack dynamic is straightforward: if a chatbot can retrieve sensitive documents, an attacker may be able to craft inputs that cause the model to expose protected content, especially when the system confuses user intent with permission. This is amplified when assistants are connected to tickets, internal wikis, CRM notes, and HR or finance repositories, where a single leak can become a legal and operational crisis.

For startups, this is becoming a product requirement. Buyers want AI, but they also want provable boundaries: permission-aware retrieval, strong identity enforcement, logging, red-team testing, and clear failure behavior. The winners in enterprise AI will treat security architecture as a core feature, not a bolt-on.

Why It Matters: As chatbots become the front doors to enterprise knowledge, “prompt-level” security weaknesses can escalate into real data breaches.
