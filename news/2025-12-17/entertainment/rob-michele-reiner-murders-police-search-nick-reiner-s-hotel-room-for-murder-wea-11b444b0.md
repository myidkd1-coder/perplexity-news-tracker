TMZ has obtained concerning video of influencer Mary Magdalene weeks before she died ... showing her being carted away by law enforcement officers in Thailand as she yelled out in confusion.

You can see in the clip, Mary -- whose real name was Denise Jarvis -- seems unable to walk on her own and is lifted by Thai officers and loaded into a cart on November 21 near the popular Krabi walking street. She exclaims she doesn't know what's happening as multiple men push the cart. The video then shows her being walked through a building and finally, into what appears to be a hotel room so she can rest in bed. She also appears to be claiming she's "drugged."
