FPIs Start 2026 with Major Sell-off in Indian Equities

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have begun the year 2026 with significant caution, initiating a fresh wave of selling in Indian equities. In the first two trading sessions of January, FPIs divested shares worth ₹7,608 crore, extending the selling streak that characterized the previous year. This early-year outflow underscores a persistent cautious sentiment among foreign investors towards the Indian market.

The Record Outflow of 2025

The current sell-off follows a challenging year in 2025, during which foreign portfolio investors withdrew a record sum of ₹1.66 lakh crore (USD 18.9 billion) from Indian equities. This substantial exit marked one of the most significant periods of foreign capital withdrawal in recent history, impacting market liquidity and investor sentiment throughout the year.

Driving Factors Behind the Sell-off

Several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors are cited as the primary drivers behind the sustained FPI selling. Volatile currency movements, particularly the depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar, have raised concerns. Global trade tensions and the potential imposition of tariffs by the United States have also contributed to investor unease, creating an uncertain global economic outlook. Furthermore, stretched equity valuations in certain market segments are believed to have made some investors reconsider their positions, seeking more attractive entry points.

Market Reaction and Expert Views

The persistent foreign selling has had a tangible impact on the Indian stock market, contributing to downward pressure on indices. Market participants, however, remain hopeful for a potential shift in FPI sentiment as the year progresses. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, suggests that improving domestic fundamentals could attract renewed foreign inflows. He anticipates that robust GDP growth and prospects for recovering corporate earnings will create a favourable backdrop for positive FPI flows in the coming months.

Vaqarjaved Khan, Senior Fundamental Analyst at Angel One, echoes this optimism. He points to potential stabilising factors such as normalizing India-US trade relations, a benign global interest rate environment, and stability in the USD-INR currency pair. Khan also noted that current equity valuations appear more comforting than they did last year, which could help reignite foreign investor interest.

Historical Patterns

Data from NSDL indicates that FPIs have historically shown a tendency to withdraw funds in January. This pattern has been observed in eight out of the last ten years, suggesting a degree of guardedness among foreign investors at the beginning of the calendar year. This historical context provides a framework for understanding the current outflows, though the scale and underlying reasons remain critical factors.

Future Outlook

Looking ahead, FPI flows are expected to remain highly sensitive to global cues and evolving macroeconomic developments. While domestic economic strength and corporate performance offer a potential tailwind for inflows, external uncertainties could continue to influence investment decisions. Market participants will be closely watching geopolitical events and central bank policies worldwide for signals on the future direction of foreign capital.

Impact

The sustained outflow of foreign capital can lead to increased market volatility, currency depreciation pressures, and slower equity market growth. However, a turnaround in domestic economic indicators and corporate performance could attract significant inflows, boosting market sentiment and potentially driving asset prices higher. The impact rating reflects the current uncertainty and the potential for both negative and positive shifts.

Impact rating: 7/10
