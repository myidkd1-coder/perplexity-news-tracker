The 'Burbs | Official Trailer | Peacock Original - YouTube Watch On

If you’re not going to be tuning in to Super Bowl LX (more on that in a moment), Peacock is offering some counter-programming in the form of “The ‘Burbs,” which is dropping its full season on Feb. 8.

This new black comedy comes from Celeste Hughey and is a fresh take on the 1989 Tom Hanks cult classic of the same name. Here, we follow a young couple (Keke Palmer, Jack Whitehall) who return to suburbia to take up residence in the husband’s childhood home on Ashfield Place. Life in the suburbs looks pleasant enough, but that seemingly perfect world is upended when some neighbors move in next door, bringing old secrets to the fore, and some deadly threats that shatter the illusion of this quiet cul-de-sac.— MS

Premieres Feb. 8 on Peacock

Super Bowl LX (Feb. 8 at 6:30 p.m. ET, NBC and Peacock)

Seattle Seahawks vs New England Patriots | Super Bowl Game Preview - YouTube Watch On

In a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX, Super Bowl 2026 has the Seattle Seahawks facing off against the New England Patriots. This time, though, it's Seattle that will be the favorites, thanks to an elite defense and the surprisingly good quarterback play of Sam Darnold. But it's still the Patriots in the Super Bowl, so anything is possible. You can watch Super Bowl LX live on NBC via a live TV streaming service or on Peacock in stunning 4K. — MM

Stream Super Bowl LX live on Peacock starting Feb. 6 at 6:30 p.m. ET

‘Cross’ (Feb. 11, Prime Video)

Cross Season 2 - Official Trailer | Prime Video - YouTube Watch On

“Cross” was an obvious hit for Prime Video, quickly claiming the No. 1 spot after its debut and earning a fast-tracked renewal for season 2. Whether you’re a longtime fan of James Patterson’s novels or just meeting Alex Cross for the first time, the streamer’s sophomore season already looks to be a gripping watch. “Cross” centers on a homicide detective who uses forensic psychology to pursue killers and get inside their heads. On my watchlist now, please!

In “Cross” season 2, Det. Alex Cross (Aldis Hodge) returns with a new investigation that puts him on the trail of a dangerous vigilante targeting powerful figures. After billionaire Lance Durand seeks protection following ominous threats, Cross and FBI Agent Kayla Craig (Alona Tal) team up to keep him safe and uncover who is behind the deadly attacks. As the eight‑episode season unfolds, Cross follows a series of gruesome clues and expanding leads that take him deeper into a complex case. — Alix Blackburn

Premieres Feb. 11 on Prime Video

‘How to Get to Heaven from Belfast’ (Feb. 12, Netflix)

How to Get to Heaven from Belfast | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On

I was sold on “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” the moment I heard it was in production. That’s because it’s the new show from Lisa McGee, the creator of the phenomenal and endlessly rewatchable “Derry Girls.” McGee’s already responsible for one of the best comedies of the 21st century, so here’s hoping that magic can be found here, too.

If the name didn’t cue you in, like “Derry Girls,” “How to Get to Heaven from Belfast” is set in McGee’s native Northern Ireland, and centers on three childhood friends who are reunited after the death of the estranged fourth member of their adolescent gang. Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher), Robyn (Sinéad Keenan) and Dara (Caoilfhionn Dunne) find themselves drawn into a dark mystery and set off on a dangerous and hilarious odyssey in search of answers. — Rory Mellon

Premieres Feb. 12 on Netflix

‘Neighbors’ (Feb. 13, HBO and HBO Max)

Nobody can create tension quite like the Safdie brothers, and "Neighbors" feels like it will have plenty of tense, absurd moments. Created by "Marty Supreme" director Josh Safdie and produced by A24, this new docuseries goes into real U.S. neighborhoods and catches real neighbors in real conflict with each other. If you want to watch how truth is stranger than fiction, then this show is a must-watch. — MM

Premieres Feb. 13 on HBO Max

‘56 Days’ (Feb. 18, Prime Video)

56 Days | Official Trailer - YouTube Watch On

February looks set to bring a wave of new adaptations, including “56 Days.” This show is based on the bestselling novel by Catherine Ryan Howard, and looks like an erotic thriller with plenty of suspense, mystery, and heat, with particularly intense and intriguing character dynamics. Sometimes you can’t go wrong with a steamy thriller that aims to twist your expectations in the most daring way.

“56 Days” follows Oliver Kennedy (Avan Jogia) and Ciara Wyse (Dove Cameron), who meet by chance in a supermarket and quickly begin an intense, fast‑moving relationship. Fifty‑six days after their first encounter, homicide investigators arrive at Oliver’s apartment to find a brutally murdered, decomposed body that can’t initially be identified. As detectives probe the crime scene, the story shifts between a single, pressure‑filled day of investigation and flashbacks revealing how events unfolded during the couple’s brief but volatile time together. — AB

Premieres Feb. 18 on Prime Video

‘The Night Agent’ season 3 (Feb. 19, Netflix)

The Night Agent: Season 3 | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On

"The Night Agent" stars Gabriel Basso as Night Agent Peter Sutherland. He's tasked with stopping some of the most dangerous threats to the U.S., and in season 3, he's tracking down a Treasury Agent accused of murdering their boss. Can he stop them from getting away with sensitive government intel? Or will the dangerous people he's tangling with take him down? You'll have to watch the latest season of this hit spy thriller to find out. — MM

Premieres Feb. 19 on Netflix

‘Paradise’ season 2 (Feb. 23, Hulu)

Paradise Season 2 | Official Teaser | Hulu - YouTube Watch On

Sterling K. Brown is back as Xavier Collins, a Secret Service agent on President Cal Bradford's (James Marsden) security detail. In season 1, it was revealed that not all is what it seems, and Xavier uncovers a vast conspiracy at the heart of the government. He also discovers his wife, long thought dead, is still very much alive. Now, in season 2, he's going to find her by any means necessary. — MM

Premieres Feb. 23 on Hulu

‘Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans’ (Feb. 25 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, CBS and Paramount+)

Survivor 50: In The Hands Of The Fans Trailer - YouTube Watch On

"Survivor" returns on Feb. 25 for its historic 50th season. But this season will be unlike any other, as Jeff Probst is bringing a 24-player cast of returning legends and "New Era" favorites to battle over the 26-day season 50. Set in Fiji, this season will differ in a big way, as fans can now get in on the action by voting on gameplay elements, including who goes to what tribes or gets certain advantages. — MM

Premieres Feb. 25 on Paramount+

‘Scrubs’ (Feb. 26, Hulu)

A new season of #Scrubs premieres February 25 on ABC. Stream on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+! - YouTube Watch On

After years of rumors and well over a decade after “Scrubs” originally came to an end, the beloved medical sitcom is finally, actually making a comeback for a nine-episode 10th installment at the end of February.

Nearly 16 years after the show concluded, we’re heading back to Sacred Heart Hospital and, while the world of medicine might’ve changed, JD (Zach Braff) and Turk’s (Donald Faison) bromance sure hasn’t. Get ready to check back in with them, plus Elliot (Sarah Chalke), Carla (Judy Reyes), and Dr. Cox (John C. McGinley) and a fresh set of interns and new staff members when the show returns. The new “Scrubs” revival is due to premiere back-to-back on ABC on Feb. 25, and will then begin streaming on Hulu the very next day. — MS

Premieres Feb. 26 on Hulu

‘Bridgerton’ season 4 part 2 (Feb. 26, Netflix)

Bridgerton Season 4 | Official Trailer | Netflix - YouTube Watch On

If, like me, you’ve already raced through the first part of “Bridgerton” season 4, you’ll be looking forward to the end of February, as that’s when we’ll be returning to the 'ton to see how the rest of this Netflix romance will pan out.

Frankly, after Benedict ruined that passionate encounter on the stairs by asking Sophie to be his mistress, I’m not entirely sure how the latest leading Bridgerton sibling can patch things up between them. We’ll find out what’s next for the pair, plus this season’s other romances, and catch up on everything else that’s troubled Mayfair this season (including the fallout from the “maid war”) when “Bridgerton” season 4 part 2 brings the beloved period drama’s latest chapter to a close. — MS

Premieres Feb. 26 on Netflix

'Monarch: Legacy of Monsters' season 2 (Feb. 27, Apple TV)

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters — Season 2 Official Teaser | Apple TV - YouTube Watch On

In "Monarch: Legacy of Monsters" season 2, the fate of the world hangs in the balance. We're returning to Skull Island and uncovering buried secrets, but we're also uncovering a mysterious village where a mythical Titan rises from the sea. For those who love monsters, don't worry. Godzilla and Kong will feature in season 2. But it's "Titan X" whose arrival will be the driving force this season, and you don't want to miss it. — MM

Premieres Feb. 27 on Apple TV

Must-watch movies in Februray

‘Eternity’ (Feb. 13, Apple TV)

Eternity — Official Trailer | Apple TV - YouTube Watch On

Back in November, Tom's Guide editor Malcolm McMillan lauded “Eternity” as “one of the best rom-coms [he’d] seen in years.” I’d concur, as David Freyne’s fantastical, afterlife-set romantic comedy is a real charmer.

The movie centers on one woman, Joan (Elizabeth Olsen), who passes away and arrives in the afterlife. There, she’s greeted by her “Afterlife Coordinator,” who presents her with a big choice: who does she want to spend eternity with? Will she spend time immemorial with Larry (Miles Teller), the man she married and built a life with, or will she reconnect with her first love, Luke (Callum Turner)? If you’re looking for romantic watches this month, this one’s dropping on Apple TV just in time for Valentine’s, and it’s a movie I’m confident viewers will fall for. — MS

Premieres Feb. 13 on Apple TV

‘Dead of Winter’ (Feb. 20, HBO Max)

Dead of Winter | Official Trailer (HD) | Vertical - YouTube Watch On

I don’t think I’ve ever seen Emma Thompson in a thriller before, but her latest, “Dead of Winter” (2025), proves she can carry one with ease. While it might not be the most groundbreaking thriller of the year, it delivers plenty of suspense to keep you engaged, and its bittersweet ending leaves you feeling satisfied, even after the surprising twist. With the winter season in full swing, it’s the perfect time to stream and see Thompson step outside her usual roles.

“Dead of Winter” follows Barb (Thompson), a recently widowed woman driving through snowy northern Minnesota to scatter her late husband’s ashes at a remote lake. Caught in a blizzard with no cell signal, she stops at a secluded cabin and discovers a teenage girl being held captive by a dangerous couple (Judy Greer, Marc Menchaca). With her truck stuck and no immediate help available, Barb becomes the girl’s only chance for escape. — AB

Premieres Feb. 20 on HBO Max

‘The Bluff’ (Feb. 25, Prime Video)

The Bluff - Official Trailer | Prime Video - YouTube Watch On

Described as a “swashbuckler action thriller,” “The Bluff” gives big “Pirates of the Caribbean” energy but with a more violent edge, and I’m here for it. Set in the 1800s, when ruthless pirates rule the high seas, Ercell Bodden (Priyanka Chopra) is a former pirate who has left her criminal life behind to live a peaceful existence with her family.

But while she’s moved on from her cutthroat past, skeletons from her former pirate days aren’t quite so finished with her. When dangerous mercenaries under the command of Captain Connor (Karl Urban) attack, Ercell is forced into a brutal battle to protect her loved ones. I’m cautiously optimistic that Prime Video might finally have an original movie winner on its hands with “The Bluff.” — RM
