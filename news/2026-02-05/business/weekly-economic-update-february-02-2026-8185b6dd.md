## Full Article
Stocks were mixed last week as investors navigated Q4 corporate results, a widely expected Fed decision, and a handful of economic reports.



The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.34 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index edged down 0.17 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.42 percent. By contrast, the MSCI EAFE Index, which tracks developed overseas stock markets, rose 1.22 percent.1,2

S&P 500 Touches 7,000

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced early in the week as investors looked ahead to the Fed meeting and corporate results from several large companies.3,4

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady, as widely expected. Market reaction was muted, with all three major averages little changed by the close. Disappointing earnings results from one megacap tech firm, announced after the market closed on Wednesday, unsettled investors and dragged the Nasdaq down on Thursday.5,6

Stocks opened lower Friday, after the White House nominated Fed veteran Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair. A warmer-than-expected December wholesale inflation report and concerns about a government shutdown added to bearish investor sentiment as the week wrapped up.7

The Fed Holds Steady

The Fed funds rate was held at its current 3.5 percent to 3.75 percent target range at its January meeting. The decision followed three consecutive meetings at which the Fed cut rates; it marked the first time the Fed held rates steady since July. The next Fed meeting is in mid-March.8

At the post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Powell did not answer any questions regarding the Justice Department’s investigation. The January 19, 2026, issue of Weekly Market Insights misstated the status of the investigation concerning the Fed Chair by referring to it as an indictment. We regret any confusion.

Tax Tip

Know and Understand Your Correct Filing Status

Taxpayers should understand their filing status well and at least be familiar with the other choices.

When preparing and filing a tax return, the filing status affects:

If the taxpayer is required to file a federal tax return

Their standard deduction amount

If they can claim certain credits

The amount of tax they should pay

Here are the five filing statuses:

Single: This status is normally for taxpayers who are unmarried, divorced, or legally separated under a divorce or separate maintenance decree governed by state law.

Married filing jointly: If a taxpayer is married, they can file a joint tax return with their spouse. When a spouse passes away, the widowed spouse can usually file a joint return for that year.

Married filing separately: Married couples can choose to file separate tax returns in certain circumstances.

Head of household: Unmarried taxpayers may be able to file using this status, but special rules apply.

Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child: This status may apply to a taxpayer if their spouse died during one of the previous two years and they have a dependent child. Other conditions also apply.

This information is not a substitute for individualized tax advice. Please discuss your specific tax issues with a qualified tax professional.

Healthy Living Tip

Keeping Your Heart Rate Up Indoors

A rainy day can steal our motivation to leave the comfort of our homes unless we have to. But your workouts don’t need to stop during inclement weather. Here are a few ways to feel the burn indoors while Mother Nature keeps it cool outside.

Hop to it with a rebounder (a mini trampoline) or a jump rope. If you have neither, fake it by keeping your hands to your sides and rotating them as you mimic the rest of the exercise sans equipment.

Find a YouTube video or other streaming guided workout. Can’t squeeze in a full half hour at once? Pause it and return when you’re ready.

Invest in workout equipment you know you’ll use. If you run or hike, consider a treadmill with an adjustable incline. If you like to ride your bike, consider getting a stationary one.

There are many ways to stay fit when the weather isn’t cooperating. But remember to always discuss any medical concerns with your healthcare provider before beginning any fitness routine; the information provided is not a substitute for medical advice.
