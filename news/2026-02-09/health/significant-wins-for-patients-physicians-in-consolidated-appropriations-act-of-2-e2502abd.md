## Summary
The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2026 includes AMA-endorsed policies like virtual expansion of Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program through 2029 and five-year extension of Acute Hospital Care at Home waiver.

## Full Article
After a short partial government shutdown, H.R. 7148, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2026 was signed into law this week by President Trump. The legislation included funding for the Department of Health and Human Services—as well as a number of AMA health care policy wins, reflecting years of sustained AMA advocacy:

Medicare telehealth extensions

Section 6209 extends Medicare telehealth flexibilities for two years, through Dec. 31, 2027.

Following the disruptive 43-day lapse during the 2025 government shutdown, this extension restores continuity of care for Medicare beneficiaries.

The AMA strongly supports this extension and continues to advocate for permanent authorization of Medicare telehealth flexibilities.

Alternative payment model (APM) incentives restored

Section 6204 reinstates APM incentive payments at 3.1% for the 2026 performance year/2028 payment year.

The legislation lowers the Qualifying Participant (QP) revenue threshold from 75% back to 50% for the same performance year.

These provisions respond directly to AMA advocacy following the expiration of APM bonuses and the automatic QP threshold increase in 2025, restoring meaningful incentives for physician-led value-based care.

Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program—virtual expansion

Section 6214 includes the PREVENT DIABETES Act, an AMA-endorsed policy expanding access to the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP).

For the first time, CDC-recognized virtual diabetes prevention programs will be included in the MDPP expanded model on a trial basis from Jan. 1, 2026, through Dec. 31, 2029.

This addresses longstanding access barriers and improves reach in rural and underserved communities.

Medicare Advantage provider directory accuracy reform

Section 6220 includes the Requiring Enhanced and Accurate Lists of (REAL) Health Provider Act, shaped by extensive AMA input.

Medicare Advantage plans must maintain accurate, regularly updated provider directories and publicly report accuracy rates.

CMS oversight, GAO evaluation, public reporting, and dedicated funding strengthen accountability and enforcement.

Five-year extension of Acute Hospital Care at Home

Section 6210 extends the Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCaH) waiver for five years, through 2030.

This preserves a proven, physician-led model delivering hospital-level care safely in the home, with strong outcomes and high patient satisfaction.

Hospital-at-home programs allow physicians to treat patients in the most appropriate setting while preserving inpatient capacity for higher-acuity care.

Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act reauthorization

Section 6508 reauthorizes and expands the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act for five years, through FY 2030.

The bill continues funding, mandates annual stigma-reduction campaigns, broadens grant eligibility to address administrative burden, and aligns grant periods with the authorization length.

The AMA has supported this program since its inception and strongly supports its reauthorization.

PBM reform

The legislation includes targeted pharmacy benefit manager reforms to enhance transparency, curb abusive Medicare drug rebate practices, and strengthen enforcement against anti-competitive behavior.

These provisions represent tangible progress toward lowering prescription drug costs and improving fairness in the drug supply chain.

Maternal health

The bill reauthorizes the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act to expand federal research on preterm birth and improve outcomes for premature infants.

It also reauthorizes the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, increases authorized funding to $100 million annually through 2030, expands the scope of state maternal mortality review committees, and directs federal agencies to more regularly disseminate best practices.

The AMA endorsed both bills. On Jan. 30, the AMA sent a letter (PDF) re-endorsing the PREEMIE Act, sponsored by Reps. Robin Kelly (D-IL) and Mariannette Miller-Meek (R-IA). The AMA also sent letters of endorsement for S. 2621/H.R. 1909 (PDF), the “Preventing Maternal Deaths Reauthorization Act of 2025,” to Senators Capito (R-WVA) and Warnock (D-GA) and Reps. Buddy Carter (R-GA) and DeGette (D-CO).

AMA supports Rural Residency Planning and Development Act

On Jan. 30, the AMA sent a letter (PDF) of support to Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV) and Jill Tokuda (D-HI) for H.R. 6468, the Rural Residency Planning and Development Act of 2025. The legislation would provide support for the Rural Residency Planning and Development pilot program by providing vital funding to cover start-up costs, accreditation, faculty development recruitment, and to expand the number of trained physicians in rural settings.

As we know, there is an expected physician shortage of about 86,000 physicians by 2036, and a projected quarter fewer rural physicians practicing by 2030. The AMA looks forward to working with Congress to address these shortages and see this legislation signed into law.

AMA joins efforts to support withdrawal of new fuel economy standards regulation

The AMA signed onto a letter (PDF) with 19 health, medical, and nursing organizations to oppose a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposal to roll back fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks.

The letter notes that transportation is a major cost for American families and a major contributor to air quality and health costs for too many communities across the U.S. It calls on NHTSA to withdraw this rule, as strong federal standards are critical tools to reduce pollution-related harm to children, seniors and others most vulnerable to poor air quality caused by vehicle traffic.

The regulation proposes new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2022–2031, which roll back more stringent standards. Due to CAFE standards, average vehicle fuel efficiency in the U.S. has nearly doubled, from around 13-15 miles per gallon (mpg) in the mid-1970’s to 27.1 mpg in 2023. Improved vehicle fuel efficiency has led to commensurate reductions in air pollution, massive reductions (98-99%) in smog-forming pollutants, clearer urban skies, fewer premature deaths and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The letter maintains that the current, more stringent standards for improving fuel efficiency over time will deliver the greatest reductions in harmful pollution and realize the most public health benefits.

Feb. 20 webinar: How does licensing and credentialing application reform improve physician well-being?

Physicians, residents, and medical students should be able to seek and receive care for mental health or substance use without fear of stigma and with full confidentiality protections. Requiring disclosure of medical diagnosis or treatment when there is no current impairment, however, causes physicians and other clinicians to not seek care out of fear of losing their job, license or judgment from their peers.

Rather than continue that cycle of stigma, the AMA, Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes’ Foundation, and a growing coalition of medical partners have undertaken a national campaign to support physicians’ health and update all applications to remove inappropriate, stigmatizing questions about mental health and substance use.

What started out as a change made by a handful of states, health systems and hospitals has become a nationwide movement in just a few short years—more than 40 medical boards and 2,000 hospitals, health systems and other care facilities have adopted recommendations from the AMA and Breen Foundation to support clinicians’ health and well-being. Nearly 200 health systems have taken their commitment to physician well-being even further and earned recognition in the AMA Joy in Medicine® Health System Recognition Program. Are your state and hospital among them?

Please join the AMA for this Advocacy Insights webinar on Feb. 20 at 2:30 p.m. CT to learn more about these successes, how changes are being implemented by leading health systems, and what you can do to bring about change in your own state, hospital and health system.

Speakers:

Bobby Mukkamala, MD, president, AMA

Stefanie Simmons, MD, chief medical officer, Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes’ Foundation

Mila Felder, MD, vice president for well-being, Advocate Health

If you are unable to attend live, a recording of the presentation will be sent out to all registrants.
