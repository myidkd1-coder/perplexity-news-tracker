Top Three Market Headlines

Strong Job Growth to Start the Year: The U.S. Labor Department reported last Wednesday that U.S. employers added 130,000 jobs in January, measurably higher than the estimation of economists who projected 70,000 job adds. This promising start to the year more than doubled the number of new jobs in December and surpassed the 2025 monthly average of 15,000 additions. The healthcare and social assistance sectors dominated growth in January, contributing 82,000 and 42,000 jobs, respectively. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked downward to 4.3% from 4.4% in the prior month while average hourly earnings rose 0.4%.

Inflation Rates Slow in January: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that the all-items Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in January from the prior month, the slowest monthly pace since last July. On an annual basis, prices rose 2.4%, down from the 2.7% rate reported in December. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.3% on the month and 2.5% year-over-year; while the former was up from a 0.2% pace in December, the latter was the lowest rate of increase since March of 2021. Over the 12 months ending January, the energy index decreased 0.1% while the food index rose 2.9%.

Surge in Bond Sales to Fund AI Buildout: Alphabet Inc. (Google's parent company) raised nearly $32 billion in public debt sales last week, including a rare 100-year bond offering, to fund large scale AI infrastructure capital expenditures. Following Oracle's $25 billion bond sale in early February, the five fastest-scaling AI infrastructure firms (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle) have issued $121 billion in corporate bonds in 2025, with their total spending projected to exceed $500 billion by the end of 2026. This surge in AI‑driven borrowing has lifted projections for total U.S. corporate bond issuance to $2.5 trillion in 2026, representing an 11.8% rise from the previous year.
