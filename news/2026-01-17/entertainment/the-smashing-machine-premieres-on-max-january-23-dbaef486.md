## Summary
Dwayne Johnson stars in gritty MMA biopic 'The Smashing Machine' directed by Benny Safdie, generating awards chatter and premiering on Max Jan. 23.

## Full Article
January used to be a quiet month for streaming. Not anymore.

In 2026, the year kicks off with a surprisingly strong slate of movies across the best streaming services, including Netflix, Max, Disney+, Prime Video, Hulu, Peacock, and niche genre streamers. From prestige dramas and buzzy documentaries to franchise rewatches, cult favorites, and action-heavy comfort viewing, January’s lineup looks less like a post-holiday cooldown and more like a strategic content drop aimed at keeping subscribers locked in.

Here’s what’s worth watching in January.

January’s Biggest New Streaming Premieres

Several of the month’s most talked-about releases arrive directly on streaming, bypassing or following limited theatrical runs and leaning into star power and buzz.

The Smashing Machine (Jan. 23 on Max) – Dwayne Johnson steps far outside blockbuster mode in this gritty biopic about MMA legend Mark Kerr. Directed by Benny Safdie, The Smashing Machine has already generated serious awards chatter, and its arrival on Max positions it as one of January’s most prestige-driven releases.

If I Had Legs I’d Kick You (Jan. 30 on Max) – After earning strong festival buzz and critical acclaim during its 2025 theatrical run, Mary Bronstein’s psychologically intense drama arrives on streaming, giving a wider audience a chance to catch Rose Byrne’s award-winning performance that quickly became one of the year’s most celebrated turns.

Tron: Ares (Jan. 7 on Disney+) – After a mixed critical reception and a disappointing theatrical run last fall, the long-delayed Tron: Ares moves to streaming, giving audiences a second chance to catch the franchise’s latest entry as its AI-driven story finally lands where many sci-fi films now find their largest audience.

Bugonia (Peacock) – Yorgos Lanthimos’ English-language remake of the cult Korean film Save the Green Planet! lands on Peacock, offering something genuinely weird for viewers tired of safe choices.

Franchise Rewatches Are Everywhere in January

January is peak rewatch season, and streaming services are leaning into it hard.

James Bond Movie Collection (Netflix, Jan. 15) – Netflix drops a large portion of the Bond catalog at once, making it one of the month’s biggest nostalgia plays.

John Wick Chapters 1–3 (Max, Jan. 1) – Perfect timing for action fans looking to revisit the franchise before future spinoffs and sequels.

The Indiana Jones Saga (Disney+, Jan. 1) – Few franchises scream “January comfort viewing” louder than Indiana Jones. All four films arrive together for easy marathon viewing.

Mission: Impossible Movies (Prime Video, Jan. 1) – Tom Cruise’s high-stakes action series lands as a complete package, ideal for long winter nights.

The Hunger Games Series (Peacock, Jan. 14) – The full saga returns just as interest in the franchise remains high following recent prequels.

Comedy Classics and Cult Favorites Get a January Boost

January streaming isn’t just about prestige or spectacle. It’s also about familiarity. Max opens the month with a trio of Mel Brooks classics:

Blazing Saddles (Jan. 1)

(Jan. 1) History of the World: Part 1 (Jan. 1)

(Jan. 1) Spaceballs (Jan. 1)

These evergreen comedies thrive on repeat viewing and remain among the most rewatched titles across platforms.

The comedy slate continues with documentaries focusing on two comedy legions:

Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man! (Jan. 22 on Max)

(Jan. 22 on Max) I’m Chevy Chase and You’re Not (Jan. 31 on Max)

Together, they form a loose celebration of comedy icons, pairing nostalgia with behind-the-scenes insight.

Sci-Fi, Action, and Survival Stories Dominate the Month

Winter streaming tends to favor high-stakes stories, and January 2026 leans heavily into sci-fi and survival-driven films. Here are some classic and recent pop culture mainstays hitting streamers this month:

The Abyss (Hulu, Jan. 1) James Cameron’s deep-sea epic resurfaces, offering a reminder of practical effects–driven spectacle.

28 Weeks Later (Hulu, Jan. 1) A brutal, fast-moving sequel that remains one of the more unsettling post-apocalyptic films of the 2000s.

10 Cloverfield Lane (Paramount+, Jan. 1) A tightly wound survival thriller that benefits from repeat viewings.

Twisters (Peacock, Jan. 15) The long-awaited follow-up to Twister arrives mid-month, delivering a large-scale disaster spectacle.

Venom: Let There Be Carnage (Disney+, Jan. 22) A short, chaotic superhero entry that performs well as a quick, high-energy watch.

The Rip (Jan. 16) A gritty, heat-soaked crime thriller directed by Joe Carnahan and produced by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, who also star in the flick.

Stone Cold Fox (Jan. 9) A slick, mid-budget action thriller starring Krysten Ritter, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kiernan Shipka, that arrived quietly last fall and slipped out of theaters just as fast, gets a second life on streaming.

Why January Has Become a Streaming Power Month

What’s happening here isn’t accidental.

January now functions as a retention month. After holiday subscriptions spike, platforms load the calendar with familiar franchises, prestige titles, and easy rewatches to keep viewers engaged. The result is a month that rewards browsing, marathoning, and rediscovery rather than chasing the next viral hit.

For viewers, that means January has quietly become one of the best months to explore streaming libraries without feeling overwhelmed.

The Bottom Line

January 2026 proves that streaming’s slow season no longer exists. With major premieres, full franchise drops, and comfort-viewing staples landing across every major platform, the new year opens with one of the most well-rounded movie slates in months.

If you’re looking to settle in, revisit favorites, or finally catch up on buzzy releases, January’s streaming lineup has you covered.
