The winter movie slate continues with some long-awaited adaptations, franchise sequels, and star-studded thrillers in February 2026 that have been driving discussions among audiences. Partnering with predictive media data analytics company Diesel Labs, ScreenRant has exclusive data revealing new movies with the most chatter before their premieres. Each film is assigned a hype score, measured by engagement across various online platforms.

Films with the highest engagement are ranked by Attention Signals, which are calculated using measures such as likes, shares, comments, and views on social and video channels like Facebook and YouTube. Before reviews, box office, and viewership numbers are generally disclosed, this data provides valuable insight into which titles have made the biggest impact on prospective audiences ahead of release.

The attention scale metric is the percentage of attention based on the show or movie in the number one spot (which is represented as 100%).

This coming month, the most-hyped films cover a wide range of genres, target audience, and release type, including potential blockbuster and streaming hits. From a new Wuthering Heights movie to Neve Campbell’s Scream franchise return, some titles look likely to continue driving conversations well after their release. Continuing strong momentum in the new year, Diesel Labs’ collected data reveals an intriguing lineup for February 2026’s new movies with the most online engagement.

Thrillers, horror movies, and comedies are dominating the February 2026 release slate, with the majority of the most-hyped films being theatrical releases rather than streaming-exclusive debuts. While some late-January films will continue to have a hold on the conversation, such as Sam Raimi's Send Help, the biggest releases in February are carrying forward what looks to be an exceptional winter box office run.
