The Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, from our hands-on live at CES 2026 (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) We're covering all the CES 2026 news here, but if you want to focus on just NVIDIA and its gaming and graphics card news (among its many endeavors), we'll be going live once Jensen Huang takes the stage for the NVIDIA CES Keynote at 9pm PT in Las Vegas. You can follow along at that attached link.

Watch LG TVs do magic tricks in Las Vegas You can't spell CES without TVs, and the biggest name in TVs - LG - has some big new sets on display in Las Vegas. We got to spend some time with these high-quality displays, including one of the thinnest TV's we've ever seen - a 'Wallpaper' OLED that you have to see to believe.

(Image credit: Future/Jacob Krol) It's not all fun and games at CES 2026, we've also seen some seriously powerful computing machines, including Samsung's new Galaxy Book 6. This huge, powerhouse laptop is built on Intel's latest chip architecture, and it can handle up to 30 hours of video playback. Check out the video below, and these laptops will be coming soon, though we don't know exactly when. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We round up the best gadgets of CES 2026 that we saw on day one! (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) It's only Day 1 of CES 2026, so how much could we have possibly seen? Enough to make a list of the 11 best gadgets we saw at CES already, with some seriously cool new, retro, and upcoming technology. Have you been curious about the revenant Pebble Watch? We got hands-on in Las Vegas. Want to see the famous Samsung Galaxy Trifold live and in the flex? We flexed it for you. How about an ultrasonic knife?! I'm not joking, it's in there. Check out our list of the coolest things we've seen, and keep reading because TechRadar never sleeps, so we'll have more cool gadgets when you check back.

(Image credit: Jacob Krol / Future) Lego sets and Lego building are huge right now, whether you build in person or tear things apart in Lego Star Wars. So, it's worth spending more time looking at the latest Lego innovation. Check out our first look at this Lego Smart Brick can do, live from CES in Las Vegas, where our editors are playing and getting hands-on with all the latest! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

The biggest Lego upgrade ever (Image credit: Jacob Krol / Future) We've gotten our first look at the new Lego Smart Brick, and you can check it out on our TechRadar TikTok! All of that technology packed into the size of a single small Lego brick, it truly is the future for smart toys and building blocks. Read all about the new Smart Brick and Lego Smart Play, the biggest Lego upgrade maybe ever! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Withings reveals its 'longevity station' (Image credit: Withings) I have to applaud Withings for dreaming up a more exciting name for smart scales at CES 2026. It's billing its new Body Scan 2 as a "longevity station", because it can apparently measure your current (and future) health with greater accuracy than before. That's because its smart scale – which includes a retractable handle – can now track over 60 biomarkers, including your body composition, artery health, hypertension risk and more. Actually, after spending two weeks eating chocolate and cheese, I'm not sure I want its 90-second "longevity assessment", but it certainly sounds like a new contender for our guide to the best smart scales (if you can stomach the $599 price tag, which converts to around £445 / AU$895).

Hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) Samsung's first tri-folding phone just made its US debut at CES 2026 – and TechRadar's Editor At Large has just spent some quality time with it. Our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold review has all the details, but the takeaway is that it's a "remarkable feat of engineering" that gives you "truly pocketable big-screen tablet productivity". Its 10-inch screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio also makes a lot of sense for watching movies on the move. The only question now is how much it'll cost – in Korea, it starts at 3.59 million KRW (about $2,500) but we still don't know its official global pricing.

Behold, the robots of CES 2026 (Image credit: SwitchBot) Hello, Mark Wilson (TechRadar's UK news editor) here and I'm taking over this liveblog for the next hour. For me, CES is mainly about robots. And you know, sensible things like Qi2 phone chargers. But mainly robots. And fortunately, we've already seen a couple of promising new ones make their debuts in Las Vegas. Hot on the heels of the laundry-folding heels of the SwitchBot Onero H1 (above) is the LG CLOiD humanoid robot. Yes, it takes 45 seconds to put a wet towel into a washing machine, but one day (maybe CES 2046) that'll be down to five seconds and we'll be living in laundry dreamland. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Another exciting AI-powered gadget from the show floor is Nosh, a robot chef that uses AI to select ingredients, prep and make a meal. With 500 recipes onboard spanning various cultures, cuisines and even beverages, there's a lot to love about this home assistant, especially for those with accessibility needs. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Let's briefly head back to Lance on the show floor, where he's been trying out Fraimic, a new e-ink photo frame that creates bespoke artwork for your walls. With the power of voice prompts, WhisperAI and ChatGPT, this makes for a fun addition to your home. Just be careful you don't accidentally prompt the creation of some Eldrich horror while you're chatting about Hallowe'en plans at home. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Soundcore) "Only 5 days in, the best fitness headphones of 2026 have already been announced" – bold claims from one of our regular contributors, Tom Bedford, as he's got his sights set on Anker's new kind-of-sort-of open earbuds. So what's the source of the ambiguity? Well, the Aerofit 2 Pro are hybrid headphones with different modes that adjust the depth of the earbud itself extends into your ear, meaning you can benefit from both ANC and open ear audio.

What's that? Why, it's an itty-bitty teeny-weeny mini action camerini! DJI has some competition from newcomer Leaptic, a brand releasing a new kind of tiny action cam at CES. It's strikingly similar in design to the Osmo Nano, but otherwise we don't know much, only that it will shoot video at a higher 8K resolution and weighs just 35g. Stay tuned for more news this week!

Hot off the press! We've shared our first impression of Samsung's new Galaxy Z Trifold phone, and it's a doozy. Naturally, we're impressed by its thinness and screen real estate, but time will tell how performance, battery and user experience will factor in to this incredible feat of design. We've thus far only spent a few minutes with the device, so hold your horses if you're expecting a full review; that'll come in time.

(Image credit: Amazon) Josie here now to fill you in on the latest CES news. Oh, looks like Samsung’s The Frame and LG W6 'Wallpaper' have some competition in the discrete screen category, with Amazon announcing the Amazon Ember Artline, a 4K QLED TV with support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision finished with a matte coating to block reflections on the screen and ultimately reduce glare. At just 1.5 inches, it's impressively thin, and comes with over 2,000 pre-loaded artworks to spruce up your home — or you can connect it to your Amazon Photos to choose from your favorite shots. Better yet, if you're spoiled for choice, Amazon's AI has the power to help you; simply share four pictures of where the Ember Artline is hung and it'll analyze the space to recommend photos or artworks that match your decor. It also features Amazon’s Omnisense Technology for intelligent screen activation when you enter (or leave) a room.

(Image credit: Future) Straight from the halls of CES 2026 comes this report from our TV expert Al Griffin, who has seen TCL's next-generation SQD mini-LED TV, which the firm is hyping up as the 'best TV in the market.' As Al explains, SQD stands for Super Quantum Dots, and the tech alongside TCL's Deep Color System should make for some very impressive images, and will look particularly good in large TVs. That's good to hear, as the TCL X11L SQD mini-LED TV will go on sale later this month in 98 and 85-inch screens, with a 75-incher coming later.

(Image credit: Future) At CES 2026 we're trying something new: a live Q&A that allows you to ask our team of experts who are on the ground in Las Vegas about what new and exciting gadgets they're seeing. All you need to do is sign in or sign up (it's free!) to our commenting system, then post your questions and one of the team will answer it. Seen a cool-looking TV you want to know more about? Fancy the look of a laptop but want to know more about the specs? Then this is your chance to ask us directly. We'll try to get back to every question as soon as possible, though due to time zone differences and inevitable Wi-Fi wonkiness, there might be a bit of a delay, but hopefully we'll keep that to a minimum.

(Image credit: Govee) CES is a great show for smart home products, and Govee has just announced some great new smart lights, and we have all the information you need. I particularly like the look of the Ceiling Light Ultra, which comes with a 616-pixel LED matrix that can show animated scenes, though I'm slightly concerned that the price will be very expensive. Hopefully we'll get pricing information soon as well. (Image credit: Govee)

It's Matt again (you'll probably see a few of us take turns on this blog), and my colleague John Loeffler is at CES 2026 helping to cover all the computing news that will come out of the huge tech show. As with previous years, we'll be hearing from some of the biggest brands in computing, including Asus, Acer, Nvidia and Intel. (Image credit: Getty Images / Moor Studio) Before that, however, what is John looking forward to seeing at this year's show? Well, you can read his early hopes, which include wanting to see AI (artificial intelligence) features that are actually impressive. Like John, I've so far not been too impressed with AI, despite many companies promising that it will revolutionise our gadgets - and our lives. Hopefully, CES 2026 changes that, as there's no doubt there'll be plenty of talk about AI at Las Vegas this year.

It's not all big-ticket tech at CES – our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has had his hands on a new digital fidget toy with clickable buttons and a collection of pre-installed games. You also get the fun of building it, because it comes as a little kit to keep your hands busy. Check it out! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Samsung Display) Hi there! Homes editor Cat Ellis here, taking over the live blog for a moment to bring you some interesting musings on the latest developments in TV tech. We've seen some very exciting new screens at CES, but our writer Carrie Marshall thinks the latest panels might not be all they seem. New TVs from LG and Samsung promise up to 4,500 nits at peak brightness, but Carrie points out that those results would have been achieved in very specific controlled conditions, so you're not likely to need shades to watch The Night Manager any time soon.

Lance, our Editor-at-Large, is at CES in Las Vegas, and he's been posting some great videos of all the cool gadgets he's seen so far on our TikTok channel. This has led to a nice jump-scare this morning for me as I scrolled our live blog and saw a video of Lance waving a knife around. For a slightly less concerning video, here's Lance testing out what at first looks like one of Tony Stark's prototypes, but is actually a massage chair. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Apple) Morning everyone, it's Matt Hanson, Managing Editor of Core Tech, and I'll be covering CES announcements here for an hour or so. Like my boss, Marc, I am not in warm Las Vegas, but in chilly and slightly snowy Bath, UK, and the image above is an accurate depiction of how I am dressed today. Fraggle-chic, I call it.

Meet the LG C6H… (Image credit: Future) Many of the big announcements so far have been around TVs, with Samsung and LG's efforts in particular standing out. Let's start with LG – because it's making a big change for its almost-flagship 'C' series OLED for 2026, with the C6 coming in not one but two versions. Yes, that's right: you'll be able to buy either the standard C6, or the new C6H model, with the latter using a fancy Primary RGB Tandem panel, as seen in last year's flagship G5 set. This should make for better brightness and color – with the downside being that it'll only be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes. You can get more detail on the new LG C6 and C6H here, and stay tuned for further updates as we get them.

Good morning from the UK. Marc McLaren here, taking over for a post or two – but from cold, snowy London, not warm, sunny Las Vegas.

Beyond the massive TVs – looking at you, Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV – we spotted a unique take on a classic kitchen gadget at CES Unveiled. What looks like a standard knife for cutting vegetables actually uses microvibrations to make slicing and dicing much easier. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We saw the Pebble Round 2 (Image credit: Core Devices) Thanks to a suprise announcement last week, we knew we'd get the chance to see the Pebble Round 2 at CES, and our first look at the new smartwatch has arrived on TechRadar's TikTok. Now back to life thanks to Core Devices, the Pebble Round 2 is boasting an edge-to-edge, round color e-paper display and promises one week of battery life. That's a big difference compared to the other leading smartwatches, and the Round 2 arrives a decade after the previous Round watch hit the market. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Here's one peek behind the scenes, and I bet you'll see it trending on TikTok from folks visiting Samsung's space at The Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas for CES 2026. They set up a sort of tunnel within a ballroom filled with speakers and numerous projectors to change the environment and, at times, immerse you in color. It's really neat and got folks talking before they even saw all the new TVs and other gadgets. I especially like the mirror entrances at the front and back, which give the illusion that this goes on for miles.

Samsung stuns with new TVS – OLED, Frame, and Micro RGB included Samsung's First Look might be wrapped, but TechRadar is the place to be, thanks to our team of experts breaking down all that was unveiled. And the star of the show is a new concept, but one that we viewed with our own eyes – Samsung's new 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It not only stretches farther than the 115-inch model Samsung's been selling since last year, but it can also be wall-mounted or sat on a pretty incredible stand. (Image credit: Future) Similarly, the major-sized 98-inch standard Frame TV ... might well just be the TV of my dreams. Though I'm a bit scared for the eventual price reveal. Meanwhile, Samsung also made some updates to its lineup of OLED TVs. Yes, even with the arrival of Micro RGB TVs in various sizes, Samsung's still offering QLED, Neo QLED, and OLED. Notably, the flagship OLED is brighter, includes a metal stand, and will display works of art via Art Mode. Samsung reveals upgraded OLED TVs and super-sized screens at CES 2026

We'll have more from CES Unveiled shortly, but Samsung's big First Look 2025 event is about to kick off. Given that the tech giant isn't doing a formal keynote this year, this will be Samsung's big presentation. Historically, this has been the place for Samsung to unveil new TVs, home audio, and monitors, but in more recent years, it's all also been about AI, AI, and more AI. Samsung's already teased and even pre-announced some key things – including an expansion of its microRGB lineup – so it'll likely be a full presentation.

First, let's start with one of the first products that stood out to Lance Ulanoff at CES Unveiled. You can see his first look TikTok below, but SkyWheel Peak S is basically a wearable that will let you feel like you're skiing on almost any surface. Pretty neat, I'd say. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Hello and welcome to TechRadar's CES 2026 live blog. I'm your host, Jacob Krol, and I'm out in Vegas right now.
