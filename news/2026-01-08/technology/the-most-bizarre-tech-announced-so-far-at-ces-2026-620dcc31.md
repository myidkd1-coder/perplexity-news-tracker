While CES 2026 is full of tech giants unveiling their latest innovations, the real excitement comes from discovering unexpected, quirky gadgets that make you ask, “Who thought of this?”

We’re here to spotlight the wildest products we’ve found so far at CES 2026, from an AI-powered panda that responds to your touch, to Razer’s holographic anime assistant, and plenty more weirdness that makes you do a double-take.

An AI anime companion that watches you from your desk

Razer’s Project AVA, originally introduced last year as an esports AI coach, has evolved into something new: a 5.5-inch animated holographic desk companion that can assist with gaming strategies, productivity, daily organization, and even personal advice. It’s both a gaming ally and an everyday assistant. Users can choose from different characters, such as the anime girl Kira or the muscular Zane.

These digital avatars feature lifelike movements, eye-tracking, expressive faces, and lip-syncing for realistic interactions. What really stands out, though, is the constant monitoring — the device watches you and your screen using the built-in camera. It’s a bit unsettling, but since it’s still just a concept, there’s no guarantee it’ll ever become a real product.

A cuddly AI baby panda robot for older adults

An’An, the latest AI pet from Mind with Heart Robotics, combines an adorable design with a meaningful mission: supporting elderly care.

The panda bot has high-tech sensors all over its body, so it reacts naturally when you touch it. Its emotional AI remembers your voice, how you interact, and what you like, so the longer you spend time with An’An, the more personalized it gets. It provides around-the-clock emotional support to combat loneliness. Additionally, for older adults who might be struggling with memory, An’An helps keep them engaged, reminds them about daily tasks, and keeps caregivers in the loop about their well-being.

A $500 ice cube maker that uses AI to reduce noise

Smart home appliance brand GoveeLife unveiled a countertop smart ice maker that uses AI to keep things nice and quiet. The company’s patented AI NoiseGuard tech is designed to cut down on all the annoying racket you usually get from nugget ice machines. The AI detects when the machine’s about to freeze up and make noise, so it automatically defrosts before things get loud.

​The Smart Nugget Ice Maker Pro churns out fresh ice in just six minutes and can make up to 60 pounds in a day. The bucket holds 3.5 pounds of ice at a time. It’ll set you back $499.99 — which might make you think twice — but if you’re ready to upgrade your ice game, you can grab one starting January 15 at Amazon, govee.com, Walmart, or Best Buy.

An ultrasonic chef’s knife that vibrates when slicing and dicing

Depending on who you ask, this kitchen gadget could either seem too silly or very useful. Unlike traditional knives, this one from Seattle Ultrasonics features a blade that vibrates at over 30,000 times per second, allowing it to move through food with ease. This vibration technology means the knife acts much sharper than its physical edge, making tasks like slicing vegetables, meats, or bread much easier for cooks. According to the company, the vibrations are so subtle that you can’t see the blade move, hear it, or feel anything in the handle.

The knife is priced at $399 and is currently available for preorder.

A musical lollipop that plays Ice Spice in your head

Musical toothbrushes exist, so why not have music-playing lollipops too? Lollipop Star showcased its tasty product at CES, which delivers music through bone conduction while in your mouth. (The technology works by sending vibrations through your skull bones directly to your inner ear.) The lollipops also provide a burst of fruity flavor. You can choose from three artists: Ice Spice (peach), Akon (blueberry), and Armani White (lime).

This Wall-E-inspired robot patrols your home and can also join you on camping trips

Zeroth Robotics introduced the W1 at CES, a robot reminiscent of WALL-E.

The W1 is a programmable companion designed for families. According to the company’s website, for $4,999, the robot offers round-the-clock AI-powered security, 360-degree mobile surveillance, and integrates with smart home devices for instant smoke and intrusion alerts. It’s also marketed as an adventure companion that can transport camping gear, follow you around the campsite taking photos as a family photographer, and supply portable power so you can enjoy entertainment on the go.

However, the company hasn’t mentioned whether the robot can sort trash or retrieve trinkets—a missed opportunity, in our opinion.
