## Summary
Spotlights proven health approaches like diet, exercise, and vaccines against respiratory infections and cancers. Notes mRNA COVID vaccines linked to longer survival in cancer patients and declining cervical cancer from HPV shots.

RFK Jr. and his MAHA allies have led an all-out assault on vaccines since he became the head of HHS. His campaign flies in the face of a tenet of the movement — its emphasis on preventing and reducing chronic illness. As doctors and medical scientists have raced to refute RFK Jr.’s vaccine falsehoods, they have underscored that immunizations have multiple, proven benefits: They prevent patients from getting a range of contagious infections. They help reduce the serious harms that diseases can wreak on those who get them. And they typically help protect broader communities from illnesses by bolstering “herd immunity.” Experts have urged patients to talk to their doctors and medical specialists about getting the appropriate “jabs” (as the British call them) for themselves and their loved ones. Young folks — who are especially vulnerable to many preventable illnesses — can see huge benefits from getting the medically recommended regimens of shots. Vaccines also can be a boon to seniors and those with chronic conditions. As conspiracists like RFK Jr. and others have attacked vaccines, which many experts consider to be perhaps medicine’s single biggest achievement against a range of illnesses, researchers are finding unexpected new reasons for widespread vaccination. As the Washington Post reported: “Vaccines don’t just shield you from specific infectious diseases or help make symptoms less severe if you get sick but can also prevent common chronic illnesses, including some cancers, according to public health experts. ‘We now have a more full understanding of how these vaccines go beyond just protecting us against the disease that they helped prevent,’ said Richard Martinello, chief medical officer and infectious diseases physician at Yale School of Medicine. In addition to cancer, a growing body of research has shown that vaccines can reduce the risk of developing dementia and heart conditions. Vaccines can also help people with existing chronic conditions avoid getting sicker.” Seniors may enjoy big benefits from getting the shingles shot to prevent painful adult resurgences of the virus that causes childhood chicken pox, the newspaper reported: “Multiple large-scale studies have reported a connection between the shingles vaccine and reduced risk of dementia. In one study of more than 280,000 adults in Wales, researchers found that the vaccine lowered the chances of developing dementia by 20% over a seven-year period. Some research also suggests the vaccine could reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease. A study of more than 1 million people in South Korea age 50 or older found that those who received a shingles vaccine had a 23% lower risk of heart problems.” Doctors now can immunize patients against multiple respiratory infections (like the flu, coronavirus, pneumonia and RSV), preventing the illnesses or reducing their harm. Those who already struggle with chronic illness can suffer major consequences after getting a common illness like the flu, experts told the Washington Post, which also noted this: “One study of 46 million adults in England observed that the incidence of heart attacks and strokes dropped after people received coronavirus vaccinations. The vaccines have been linked to a risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle and lining, but cases are rare and generally mild.” As with all medical interventions, vaccines carry risks. But long experience with them — with hundreds of millions of patients receiving them over centuries — have shown medical experts that their benefits far outweigh their potential harms. New ammunition against cancers Doctors and medical researchers are expressing optimism that vaccines may help battle one of the nation’s leading killers: cancer. The increase of young patients getting vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) already is leading to measurable declines in cervical cancer. The HPV shot also helps to protect against other cancers of the female reproductive system as well as head and neck cancers, the Washington Post reported. RFK Jr. stunned medical experts shortly after taking office by slashing $500 million in already announced U.S. support for research into mRNA vaccines. He then asserted with little evidence that such vaccines — the most famous of which helped turn the tide on the coronavirus pandemic — were unsafe and ineffective. Despite that big funding blow, research on this novel therapy has continued — and studies show mRNA has potential in battling various types of cancers. As Jeff Collier, a Johns Hopkins biology professor and entrepreneur, reported in a Wall Street Journal essay]: “A new study has found that patients who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines while undergoing certain cancer treatments lived significantly longer than unvaccinated patients receiving the same treatments … This new research shows the mRNA vaccine also activated powerful immune pathways that enhanced the body’s natural defense network and strengthened its readiness to fight cancer. Researchers don’t fully understand why this occurred or why the effect was so potent. Unlocking those mechanisms could open the door to even more-effective therapies.” Scientific American, in a more detailed look, reported that more than five dozen studies are under way, attacking 20 different cancers with mRNA therapies. The major risk so far in this field comes, Scientific American reports, from the administration’s hostility toward mRNA vaccines. As 2025 ended, RFK Jr. had slashed federal funding for the American Academy of Pedatrics, a leading medical specialist group that has vowed to protect young patients in part by putting out medically accurate information about vaccines. The doctors have sued the administration, calling the funding cut retaliatory. The health secretary also has floated a widely denounced plan to replace the vaccine schedule for this country (with its population ~340 million) with a version used in Denmark (pop. 6 million — about the size of Atlanta). As a vaccine expert wrote in the Washington Post, this idea is akin to taking the operating instructions for a toy plastic plane and trying to use them to fly a supersonic jet.
