Modern Healthcare: Health Insurance CEOs To Face Daylong Grilling On Capitol Hill

Congress has agreed on little after a year of sparring over escalating healthcare costs and shrinking subsidies, with a notable exception: Big health insurance companies are not helping. On Thursday, the CEOs of five of major insurers will face a daylong grilling on Capitol Hill, where they will get to make their case before two separate House committees, and likely be targets for pent up anger from both sides of the aisle.

Modern Healthcare: Blue Cross Campaign Targets University Of Vermont Medical Center

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont’s provocative new marketing campaign points a finger at the state’s largest academic medical center for sending exchange premiums to the highest level in the nation. The nonprofit health insurance company partnered with Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans and three other independent providers.

KFF Health News and Gulf States Newsroom: Farmers Now Owe A Lot More For Health Insurance

Last year was a tough one for farmers. Amid falling prices for commodity crops such as corn and soybeans, rising input costs for supplies like fertilizer and seeds, as well as the Trump tariffs and the dismantling of USAID, many farms weren’t profitable last year. And now, the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that many Americans, including farmers, relied on to purchase health insurance are gone, having expired at the end of December.

MedPage Today: Health Groups Pleased With Proposed NIH Budget In Bipartisan Funding Bill

Health groups praised many of the provisions in the joint House-Senate bill that would fund the NIH and several other agencies under HHS for fiscal year 2026.

Fierce Healthcare: Congress Proposes Extensions For Virtual Care In Funding Bill

Medicare telehealth flexibilities and the Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCaH) program are teed up to receive multi-year extensions from Congress in its recently released funding package for the Department of Health and Human Services. The extensions would provide more certainty for the industry than it’s had since the end of 2022, when Congress extended Medicare telehealth and hospital-at-home for two years. Since the end of 2024—and President Donald Trump's election—providers and hospitals have faced a series of months-long virtual care extensions as Congress struggled to find a bipartisan solution to fund the government.

Politico: Congress’ Health Deal Still Has Hurdles

After months of fruitless negotiations to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies that have since expired, congressional leaders announced Tuesday they’d notched a rare bipartisan win to overhaul other parts of the health care system. Now they just have to hold onto it. The agreement, attached to a government spending bill, would implement long-sought changes to the way pharmacy benefit managers operate, as well as extensions of public health programs and increased funding for community health centers. But even with strong support in both chambers, the bill faces significant hurdles. (King, Chu and Guggenheim, 1/22)
