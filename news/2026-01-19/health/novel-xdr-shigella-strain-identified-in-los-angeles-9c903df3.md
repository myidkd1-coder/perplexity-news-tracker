San Francisco Chronicle: Kaiser Affiliates To Pay $556 Million In Medicare Fraud Scheme

Kaiser Permanente affiliates were ordered to pay $556 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the healthcare provider defrauded Medicare by using falsified medical information to increase reimbursements, the Justice Department said. The settlement puts an end to claims that affiliates of Kaiser Permanente — the Oakland-based healthcare giant — violated federal law by pressuring doctors to add certain diagnoses to patients’ medical records after visits had already happened, according to the Justice Department. That allowed Kaiser to receive higher payments from Medicare Advantage, the federal records say. (Toledo, 1/14)

Two days into the largest nursing strike New York City has seen in decades, Mount Sinai Hospital made a startling accusation. Three nurses had been fired, administrators said, after they were caught “deliberately sabotaging” the labor-and-delivery floor by hiding critical supplies for newborns so that replacement nurses would not find them. “This is completely unacceptable behavior,” the hospital said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that the action last week risked “interfering with patient safety.” (Goldstein, 1/14)
