## Summary
Russia supports India's oil strategy after US claims of stopping Russian crude purchases; India buys over one million barrels daily, prioritizing energy security and strategic autonomy.

## Full Article
India’s oil strategy is once again under the global spotlight after US President Donald Trump claimed that New Delhi agreed to stop buying Russian crude under a recent trade deal. Russia has publicly contradicted that assertion, saying India is free to choose its energy partners and that there is nothing new in Delhi diversifying oil sources. India currently buys over one million barrels of Russian oil per day, making it Moscow’s second-largest buyer and accounting for nearly a third of India’s total imports. This partnership helped India cushion fuel prices during global volatility after 2022. With 88 percent of its crude imported, energy security remains a non-negotiable priority for New Delhi. Experts warn that US oil cannot easily replace Russian supplies due to differences in crude grades and refinery design. Moscow has also stated that it has received no communication from India about stopping purchases. The episode reinforces India’s long-standing position that strategic autonomy guides its foreign and economic policy. Cooperation with one country does not imply cutting ties with another, and no external power dictates India’s energy decisions.
