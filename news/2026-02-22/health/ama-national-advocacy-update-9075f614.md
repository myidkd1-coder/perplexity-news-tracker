Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on “How Washington’s Rules Drove Physicians Out of Medicine”

On Feb. 11, the Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing entitled "The Doctor is Out: How Washington's Rules Drove Physicians Out of Medicine," and it focused on causes driving physician burnout, administrative burdens on physicians (including prior authorization reform), and health care staffing issues generally, among other key topics. Ranking Member Gillibrand highlighted the "pervasive stigma against seeking mental health support" and called for reforms to streamline prior authorization, improve EHR usability, and address the root causes of burnout through bipartisan cooperation. Prior authorization was consistently cited as a major problem. There was bipartisan interest in streamlining these processes, with multiple speakers referencing the Improving Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act as a potential solution.

Members of both parties and all the witnesses agreed that administrative burden is a primary cause of physician burnout as well as a threat to patient care. The AMA is supportive of the Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act, as well as the Dr. Lorna Breen Healthcare Provider Protection Reauthorization Act.

AMA pushes CMS to develop separate codes for high-cost medical supplies

The AMA is calling (PDF) on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to create separate billing codes for supplies costing over $500, starting with the 2027 Medicare Physician Payment Schedule. This change would improve pricing accuracy, incentivize care in lower-cost settings like physician offices, and enhance program integrity by making billing more transparent and preventing improper payments. The AMA letter also includes a call for annual reviews and updates of supply codes to ensure transparency and reflect market changes. We believe this approach will boost access to advanced care and support physicians nationwide.

HHS OCR announces new enforcement program centered on confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced a new enforcement focus to protect the confidentiality of substance use disorder (SUD) patient records. Under new regulatory requirements that took effect on Feb. 16, HHS OCR has civil enforcement mechanisms available to protect the confidentiality of SUD patient records by covered SUD programs.

The new regulatory requirements are commonly referred to as the “Part 2” Rules as they originate from the 42 CFR Part 2 Regulation. The Part 2 Rules establish limitations on when SUD patient records may be shared, requirements for single consent and redisclosure, and prohibitions on using SUD patient records against a patient. OCR investigations conducted under the new program may be resolved through a range of civil enforcement mechanisms.

As of Feb. 16, OCR began accepting complaints alleging violations of the regulation that protects the confidentiality of SUD patient records and notification of breaches of SUD patient records.

To support these new regulatory requirements, the AMA updated its Model Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Notice of Privacy Practices (NPP) for HIPAA Covered Entities. Every provider should consult their legal counsel regarding the changes required for NPP content.

AMA opposes proposed Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP rules that interfere with the practice of medicine and the physician-patient relationship

On Feb. 17, the AMA sent letters opposing two CMS proposals that would interfere with the practice of medicine and undermine the physician-patient relationship.

The proposed rules would: (1) establish a new (PDF) Medicare and Medicaid hospital Condition of Participation (CoP) prohibiting hospitals from providing certain gender-affirming care services (referred to in the rules as “sex-rejecting procedures”) to individuals younger than 18; and (2) bar the use of federal funds (PDF) to provide such services to individuals younger than 18 under Medicaid or younger than 19 under the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

The AMA's letters emphasize that these proposals are unprecedented, as CMS has never before used Medicare and Medicaid CoPs to prohibit a hospital from offering a specific service. The AMA further argues that the proposed rules exceed CMS’ statutory authority, which expressly does not permit federal interference in the practice of medicine, and would improperly intrude on the physician-patient relationship and clinical decision-making.

The AMA is requesting that CMS withdraw both proposed rules.

Youth Sports Facilities Act promotes fitness and health lifestyle among young people

On Feb. 12, the AMA sent letters in support of S. 1419/ H.R. 2850 (PDF), the Youth Sports Facilities Act. The bipartisan, bicameral legislation was introduced on April 10, 2025, by Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and Todd Young (R-IN), and in the House by Reps. Bill Huizenga (R-MI) and Marc Veasey (D-TX). The legislation would promote fitness and healthy lifestyle choices among young people by allowing public works and economic development grants to be used for the construction or enhancement of youth sports facilities.

The AMA and physicians are mindful of the critical role regular exercise plays in preventing and managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and high blood pressure. The AMA is committed to promoting regular physical exercise as one of the most important contributors to a healthy lifestyle and looks forward to continuing to work with the Members of Congress in supporting this legislation across the finish line.
