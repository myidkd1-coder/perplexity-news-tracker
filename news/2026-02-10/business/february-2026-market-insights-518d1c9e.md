U.S. and Canadian Markets

Stocks climbed in January as the tailwinds of solid economic data offset the headwinds of geopolitical tensions that rattled investors during the month.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.37 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.95 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.73 percent. The Toronto Stock Exchange picked up 0.66 percent.¹ ²

A Choppy Rise

Stocks rose early in the month as 2026 kicked off, with the AI trade—led by chip manufacturers—setting the pace.

Investors liked what they heard about inflation, which was followed by a solid retail sales report. However, geopolitical tensions and mixed results from money center banks put some pressure on stock prices.⁵

Investors were also encouraged when the White House said it was pursuing diplomatic approaches to resolve the international debate over Greenland while walking back talk about new tariffs.⁶

Stocks largely went sideways during the last week of trading as investors flocked to megacap tech names ahead of fourth-quarter reports, which pushed the S&P 500 above the 7,000 level for the first time.⁷

Market reaction was muted to the Federal Reserve’s widely expected decision to hold interest rates steady and news that the White House nominated former Fed insider Kevin Warsh as the next Chair of the Federal Reserve.⁸ ⁹

U.S. Sectors

Eight of the 11 S&P 500 Index sectors finished the month in the green as market leadership continued to broaden beyond tech names. Energy (+14.18 percent) was the clear double-digit leader, while Materials (+8.64 percent), Consumer Staples (+7.51 percent), and Industrials (+6.65 percent) also logged solid performances. Real Estate (+2.68 percent) and Communication Services (+2.00 percent) posted more modest gains but still outperformed the S&P 500 overall. Utilities (+1.31 percent) and Consumer Discretionary (+1.47 percent) managed small gains.¹⁰

Three sectors were under pressure, including Health Care (-0.04 percent), Information Technology (-0.06 percent), and Financials (-2.43 percent).¹⁰

Canada Recap

Canada’s S&P/TSX Composite Index carried over its 2025 momentum into the new year, setting multiple record highs early in the month. Mining and materials groups were among the best performers, while financial names also contributed to the rally.¹¹ ¹²

Markets lost some momentum after the White House proposed raising tariffs following the release of the Canada-China Economic and Trade Cooperation Roadmap by Canadian officials. However, markets improved after officials clarified their position and said they were actively negotiating with the U.S.¹³ ¹⁴

What Investors May Be Talking About in February

In the month ahead, investors will continue to try separating the market’s signal from the noise created by daily headlines.

They will be watching whether interest in the stock prices broadens out beyond tech names, including AI.¹⁵

As AI begins to make its way into non-tech industries, more companies across more sectors of the economy are participating in the AI revolution.

A total of 306 S&P 500 companies mentioned AI on their third-quarter conference calls. Wall Street will be listening to companies' fourth-quarter conference calls with investors to learn if that number is expected to trend higher or lower in 2026.¹⁶

World Markets

The MSCI EAFE Index opened the year strong, picking up 5.19 percent.¹⁷ ¹⁸

In Europe, the United Kingdom (+2.94 percent) and Spain (+3.31 percent) led the way among the majors. Italy (+1.30 percent) and Germany (+0.20 percent) posted more moderate gains while France slipped 0.28 percent.¹⁸

Egypt (+14.24 percent) and Brazil (+13.70 percent) posted solid gains, while Mexico (+5.12 percent) also had a strong month.¹⁸

China’s Hang Seng Index rose 6.85 percent while Korea’s KOSPI rose 23.97 percent, extending its 2025 gains into the New Year. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei rose 5.80 percent.¹⁸
