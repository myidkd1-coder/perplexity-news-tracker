Governance and Regulation

New York Could Show Cities a Better Way to Work With Big Tech on Safety

(Nikhil Jain – Tech Policy Press) In his inauguration speech at the start of this year, Mayor Zohran Mamdani made a promise to govern New York City “expansively and audaciously.” He brings a high-profile team to lead this charge in a City Hall that he says will not hesitate to use its power to improve the lives of New Yorkers. With notable appointments such as Lina Khan, who challenged dominant technology firms as chair of the Federal Trade Commission, the Mamdani transition team has the expertise to expand the mayor’s technology governance agenda. Regulating technology platforms can be complex at any level of government. While public support for Big Tech regulation has grown as concerns like social media addiction and AI-related risks have come to light, US federal and state policymakers often fail to align on governance approaches (take AI regulation or platform transparency for instance). Local governments, as the closest form of democratic representation for many Americans, are sometimes better positioned to achieve ambitious technology governance goals, especially when the technology in question creates distinctly local impacts. Some, like New York City, have pioneered local laws in algorithmic governance, but they will need a better framework when using a more controversial lever: targeted interventions in online content moderation. – https://www.techpolicy.press/new-york-could-show-cities-a-better-way-to-work-with-big-tech-on-safety/

Lai sets goal of cultivating 500,000 ‘AI professionals’ by 2040

(Focus Taiwan) President Lai Ching-te said the government has set a goal of cultivating 500,000 “artificial intelligence professionals” by 2040 and plans to inject NT$100 billion (US$31.6 billion) into a venture capital fund to achieve this.

California Shuts Down Health Data Resales By Unregistered Brokers

(Alessandro Mascellino – Infosecurity Magazine) California privacy regulators have taken fresh action against companies accused of trading in sensitive personal data without proper authorization. The latest decisions target a marketing firm that sold health-related profiles and a global analytics provider that failed to meet registration rules. The California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) said the actions are part of its enforcement of the Delete Act, which requires businesses that buy and sell consumer data to register annually. Officials warned that information linked to medical conditions and personal behavior can pose serious risks when circulated for commercial gain. The most severe penalty was imposed on Rickenbacher Data LLC, operating as Datamasters. Regulators found the Texas-based company bought and resold personal data tied to millions of people in 2024 without registering as a data broker in California. – https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/california-shuts-health-data/

Concerns raised over scope of planned EU-US biometrics deal

(EURACTIV) An EU-US deal under negotiation to allow the transfer of biometric and other sensitive data on European citizens to US authorities in exchange for continued visa-free travel is raising legal concerns. Under the proposed “Enhanced Border Security Partnerships”, the US and EU would exchange data – potentially including biometrics and information on sensitive topics like political views, health conditions and sexual orientation – a demand Washington first made several years ago as a condition for maintaining visa-free travel. Details of the plan remain scant, as EU governments have only just given the European Commission a mandate to start negotiating an EU-wide framework for the partnerships on their behalf. – https://www.euractiv.com/news/concerns-raised-over-scope-of-planned-eu-us-biometrics-deal/

World Economic Forum: Cyber-fraud overtakes ransomware as business leaders’ top cyber-security concern

(Danny Palmer – Infosecurity Magazine) Phishing attacks and cyber fraud have overtaken ransomware as the top cybersecurity concern of business leaders, according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Cybersecurity Outlook for 2026. Released on January 12, a week before the WEF Annual Davos meeting, the report warns that cyber-enabled fraud has become a “pervasive threat” reaching “record highs” across industry and society. This is causing substantial financial losses for people and businesses as well as undermining trust in systems, the paper warned. The report, produced in collaboration with Accenture, surveyed global business leaders and revealed that 77% have reported an increase in cyber-enabled fraud and phishing overall, while 73% claimed that they or a business leader they know had been affected by it. – https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/fraud-overtakes-ransomware-as-top/

BreachForums Database Leak Turns the Tables on Threat Actors

Palo Alto Networks Introduces New Vibe Coding Security Governance Framework

(Kevin Poireault – Infosecurity Magazine) The generalization of vibe coding has already led to major security incidents, according to Palo Alto Networks. This emerging practice, which consists of writing code and developing applications via AI prompts in natural language, is being adopted by both hobbyists with zero-to-low programming knowledge and seasoned developers. In a new report published on January 8, researchers at Palo Alto’s Unit 42 acknowledged that vibe coding is a “powerful force multiplier” that allows “undeniable productivity gains” for inexperienced and experienced developers. However, vibe coding has also opened the door to new vulnerabilities, many of which currently bypass the security oversight of organizations due to inadequate governance, lack of visibility into AI-generated code and the rapid pace of adoption outstripping traditional security controls. – https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/palo-alto-networks-vibe-coding/
