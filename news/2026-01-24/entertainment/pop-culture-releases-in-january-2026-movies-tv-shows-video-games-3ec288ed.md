From Sam Raimi’s survival thriller to the return of beloved TV series and major gaming updates, here’s your complete guide to what’s dropping this month.

Movies: Theatrical Releases & Streaming Debuts

January traditionally serves as a dumping ground for studios, but 2026 is breaking that mold with an impressive slate of releases that range from blockbuster sequels to intimate dramas.

Major Theatrical Releases

Greenland 2: Migration (January 9) kicks off the month with Gerard Butler and Morena Baccarin returning to their post-apocalyptic survival saga. Picking up after the comet disaster from the first film, the Garrity family must navigate a frozen European wasteland to find a new home. Director Ric Roman Waugh brings back the tension-filled action that made the original a surprise hit.

28 Years Later: The Bone Temple (January 16) continues Danny Boyle’s zombie saga with director Nia DaCosta at the helm. Set decades after the original outbreak, this sequel promises to expand the horrifying world while potentially bringing back Cillian Murphy in a surprise cameo, though he’s confirmed as a producer.

Return to Silent Hill (January 23) brings the iconic horror franchise back to theaters after 20 years. Director Christophe Gans returns with a faithful adaptation of the beloved video game Silent Hill 2, starring Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, who receives a mysterious letter from his deceased love Mary that draws him back to the fog-shrouded town. The film features practical effects with dancers and acrobats in prosthetic makeup bringing the franchise’s nightmarish creatures to life, plus an original score from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka.

Send Help (January 30) reunites director Sam Raimi with his horror-thriller roots. Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien star as stranded colleagues who must overcome their strained relationship to survive on a deserted island after a plane crash. Expect Raimi’s signature blend of tension and dark humor.
