Contributor Series: From Prompt Design to Data Engineering – Why Architecture Matters for Agentic AI

Agentic AI is having a moment. Teams everywhere are wiring up agents that plan tasks, call tools, and act autonomously. Demos look smooth, and product pitches sound sharp. But most of these systems sit on a fragile base. At their core, agents depend on data. If that data is slow, scattered, or stale, the system breaks, no matter how good the model or prompt may be.

Exclusive: The AI Strategy Execution Gap – Why Most Companies Fail to Deliver Results

Organizations often make the mistake of treating AI too narrowly as a trendy tech investment or an efficiency play – without a thoughtful examination of desired outcomes. Instead of asking, ‘How can we do what we already do, but faster and cheaper?’ leaders should think longer-term and ask, ‘What can AI help us do that we were never able to do before?’
