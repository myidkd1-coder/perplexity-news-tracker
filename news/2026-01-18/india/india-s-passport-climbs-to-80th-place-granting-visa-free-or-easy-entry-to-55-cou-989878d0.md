Austrian Airlines extends evening-flight suspension to Tel Aviv until 31 January 2026

Austrian Airlines has prolonged the grounding of its evening Vienna–Tel Aviv flight until at least 31 January 2026 owing to heightened regional security risks. Daytime flights will proceed only after day-of-departure risk checks, and the carrier continues to detour around Iraqi and Iranian airspace. The change removes a key same-day connection for business travellers and forces corporates to re-route staff or extend itineraries, with knock-on effects for Schengen-stay planning and time-critical cargo.
