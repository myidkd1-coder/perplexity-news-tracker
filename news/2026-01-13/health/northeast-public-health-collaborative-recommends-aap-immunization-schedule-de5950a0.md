## Summary
Following CDC's January 5, 2026 memorandum reducing routine childhood vaccines, Northeast Public Health Collaborative urges adherence to AAP schedule. Criticizes changes for bypassing procedures, risking vulnerability to preventable diseases.

## Full Article
In the wake of recent revisions to federal childhood immunization guidance, the Northeast Public Health Collaborative continues to recommend the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule (PDF).

The AAP recommended immunization schedule serves as the foundation for discussions between families and their providers, as it always has. Parents should continue to make informed decisions about the vaccines that their children receive based on discussions with their child’s health care provider.

On January 5, 2026, the Acting Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) signed a decision memorandum that reduced the number of immunizations routinely recommended for all U.S. children. The authority to make vaccination requirements and recommendations lies with states and appropriate jurisdictions.

This change to U.S. childhood vaccine schedule did not follow established procedures for vaccine recommendations. This change also creates confusion for families already trying to navigate a complex system and sows doubt about the effectiveness and science behind vaccines. Historically, the U.S. childhood immunization schedule has been updated regularly based on rigorous, expert-driven risk-benefit analysis of new data. These latest recommendations threaten to leave the American public, especially children, more vulnerable to preventable illness and death.

The science is clear. Vaccines remain the best protection for keeping children and communities healthy. The vast majority of American adults and parents believe routine childhood vaccines are important for public health.

The Northeast Public Health Collaborative (NEPHC) is committed to ensuring public health guidance remains clear and grounded in science and to supporting programs that preserve access to childhood vaccines.

The Collaborative is a voluntary coalition of public health agencies working together to share expertise, improve coordination, enhance capacity, strengthen regional readiness and protect evidence-based public health in our jurisdictions. The Collaborative does not necessarily speak on behalf of every member agency or state, and each member retains its own independent positions and authorities.
