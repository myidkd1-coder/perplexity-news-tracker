Briefing the media, Misri stated, “The President of the UAE has just concluded an official visit to New Delhi. This has been a short, but extremely substantive visit. He was received at the airport personally by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which is a special gesture that reflects the extremely warm and close relationship that the two leaders share.”



He added that both leaders travelled together to the Prime Minister’s residence, where talks were held in restricted and expanded formats. “They then travel together from the airport to the Prime Minister's residence, where discussions were held, both in the restricted format and then expanded format, where delegation members engaged with each other,” he said.



Misri noted that “A number of documents were also exchanged in the presence of the leaders,” and highlighted the visit’s importance, saying, “The importance of this visit can be understood by the composition of the delegation accompanying the president of the UAE.
