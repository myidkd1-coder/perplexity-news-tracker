The top health trends of 2026

1. GLP-1 expansion

The top health trend of 2026 chosen by 52% of the polled experts was the increased use of GLP-1 medications for health conditions.

Conversations around GLP-1s have dominated the health landscape in recent years. The medications have been hailed as a weight-loss miracle drug and are used to treat a variety of conditions beyond just obesity and type 2 diabetes, with potential impacts on heart health, kidney disease, fertility, arthritis, and even addiction.

According to KFF, around one in five U.S. adults have used GLP-1 drugs, and use rates have climbed as costs have continued to go down.

"I think the explosion of GLP-1s use will continue, and with the cost decreasing, increased utilization will increase our understanding of the benefits and use for other health issues," said Melina Jampolis, an internist and board-certified physician nutrition specialist.

"GLP-1s continue to gain popularity with patients because it provides hope and the jump start for weight loss," said Alefiya Faizullabhoy, a registered dietitian and manager of the diabetes in pregnancy program at Northwell Health. "GLP-1s have shown to have cardiometabolic advantages, and likely as such a large part of funding towards research for GLP-1s is ongoing, there will be emergence of findings that GLP-1s have other advantages as well."

2. Integration of AI with wearable technology (tie)

Tied for second was the integration of AI with wearable technology for dietary tracking and coaching, according to the panel of experts.

These devices are using AI to give users more information than simply how many steps they've walked or calories they've burned, producing personalized recommendations and tips on how to improve sleep, stress management, and physical activity.

Panel experts predicted that AI will become further integrated with the health information that wearables already collect and will be used to help guide health behavioral change.

However, the experts noted that understanding all this additional data will require working alongside a healthcare provider to be most effective.

"AI is being used in every pathway, and using it as a tool will become a part of daily existence," said Faizullabhoy. "It may be used with wearable feedback devices to provide 'in time' association between food consumption and effect on, for example, glucose and other metabolic markers."
