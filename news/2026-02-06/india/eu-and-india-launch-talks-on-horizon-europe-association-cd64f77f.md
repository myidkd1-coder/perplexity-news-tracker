## Full Article
The European Commission and India have today launched exploratory discussions on the possible association to Horizon Europe. The launch of these talks follows the 16th EU–India Summit in New Delhi, where leaders from both sides reaffirmed their commitment to deepening strategic cooperation across trade, security, science, innovation and mobility.

Ekaterina Zaharieva, European Commissioner for Startups, Research, and Innovation, said:

“Science works best when borders do not get in the way of ideas. Exploring India’s association to Horizon Europe is about connecting talent, ambition and trust, and building solutions together at global scale.”

If India becomes associated, Indian researchers and institutions would be able to receive funding directly from Horizon Europe and lead projects, with India making a financial contribution to the programme.

R&I cooperation with India

EU-India cooperation on research and innovation is governed by the Agreement for Scientific and Technological Cooperation signed in 2001 and recently renewed until 2030 at the New Delhi summit.

The Joint EU–India Comprehensive Strategic Agenda Towards 2030 places research and innovation at the centre of the strategic partnership and includes the launch of exploratory talks on Horizon Europe association as a concrete deliverable.

In recent years, this cooperation has also been strengthened through the EU–India Trade and Technology Council (TTC). Commissioner Zaharieva’s visit to India last year, including exchanges in the TTC context, helped advance shared priorities and reinforce links between research and innovation ecosystems on both sides.

Horizon Europe global

Association to the EU’s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation is the closest form of international cooperation in science and technology between the European Union and a non-EU country.

At present, 22 non-EU countries are associated with Horizon Europe: Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Egypt, the Faroe Islands, Georgia, Iceland, Israel, Korea, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Türkiye, Tunisia, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.

Beyond the associated countries, negotiations for association were successfully concluded with Japan on 21 December 2025, while association negotiations with Morocco are currently paused.

Exploratory talks are currently ongoing with Australia.

Background

Exploratory discussions are non-binding and technical in nature. These discussions assess the scope, principles and conditions of a potential association agreement and prepare the ground for possible formal negotiations.
