Budget 2026-27: India Bets Big on Electronics and Semiconductors

India's Union Budget 2026-27 arrives at a critical juncture, aiming to capitalize on global supply chain realignments and geopolitical shifts. Policymakers are zeroing in on the electronics and semiconductor sector, viewing it as a strategic bet for both domestic resilience and export growth.

Consolidating Manufacturing Gains

Recent years have seen proactive government policies lay a strong foundation. Mega schemes like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) have spurred significant production and investment, while the Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS) is driving localization and reducing import reliance. Hundreds of applications and substantial investment pipelines signal strong momentum.

Policy Levers for Growth

The upcoming budget offers opportunities to deepen manufacturing capabilities. This includes ecosystem incentives, enhancing cost competitiveness, fostering supply-chain clustering, and robust skilling initiatives. Key areas for enhanced fiscal support and tax breaks will focus on semiconductor fabrication (fabs) and advanced packaging technologies.

Bridging the Fab Gap

To compete with global hubs, budget provisions could include enhanced fiscal support for fabs, such as capital expenditure incentives, tax holidays, and import duty waivers on machinery. Accelerated depreciation or special R&D incentives for advanced packaging are also anticipated to reinforce India's attractiveness.

Nurturing Innovation and Talent

Beyond manufacturing, innovation and talent are paramount. The budget may expand R&D tax credits for semiconductor research and support public-private partnerships for next-generation nodes. Skill development programs in collaboration with industry leaders will be crucial to bridge talent gaps and accelerate scaling.

Strategic Outlook

By consolidating existing gains and introducing targeted policy interventions, Budget 2026-27 aims to transform India's electronics manufacturing ambitions into a global competitive advantage, driving both Atmanirbhar Bharat and export powerhouse goals.
