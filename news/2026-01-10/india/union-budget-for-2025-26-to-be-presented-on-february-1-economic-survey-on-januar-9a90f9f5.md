The first phase of the budget session will conclude on February 13 for a nearly month-long recess. Parliament will reconvene on March 9, and the session will conclude on April 2.

"The Session will commence on 28 January 2026 and continue till 2 April 2026. The first phase concludes on 13 February 2026, with Parliament reassembling on 9 March 2026, a vital step towards meaningful debate and people-centric governance," Rijiju said.

The recess in the Budget session helps department-related standing committees to examine demands for grants of various Union ministries and departments.

Parliament has had sittings on Sundays under special circumstances, such as the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and on May 13, 2012, to mark the 60th anniversary of the first sitting of Parliament.
