## Full Article
A high-decibel political clash has erupted after Union Minister Piyush Goyal accused the Gandhi family of being politically “compromised.” Addressing the media in New Delhi, Goyal alleged that Rahul Gandhi acts as a puppet and that the Congress party has repeatedly put national interest at risk. He cited past controversies and governance decisions to argue that compromise has defined the party’s history. Goyal’s remarks mark one of the sharpest personal attacks in recent months, pushing the BJP-Congress rivalry into legacy territory. The Congress has often countered such charges as politically motivated, but the exchange underscores how confrontational India’s political discourse has become. With elections and major policy debates on the horizon, statements like these amplify partisan divides. The episode reflects a broader strategy of framing the political contest as a battle between competing visions of nationalism and accountability.
