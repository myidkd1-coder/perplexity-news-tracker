## Full Article
The White House fact sheet on the India US trade deal was revised within hours exposing the fine print of global trade politics. India objected to claims it never agreed to including tariff cuts on pulses removal of digital taxes and binding purchase commitments. The updated document now mirrors the joint statement language signalling selective reductions not blanket zero tariffs. This comes as US officials link trade talks with energy sourcing Russian oil and supply chain realignment. The episode shows India asserting its red lines refusing political and economic costs at home. Far from a concession this was a correction where Delhi ensured policy clarity before perception hardened. In trade diplomacy precision matters and India made sure the record reflected that.
