What You Need to Know: Beginning January 1, 2026, Medi-Cal will freeze new enrollments for undocumented adults aged 19 and older who currently qualify for full-scope Medi-Cal through state-funded adult expansions. Individuals already enrolled can stay covered only if they complete their annual renewal on time.

December 03, 2025Area(s) of Interest:

Beginning January 1, 2026, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) will implement a Medi-Cal enrollment freeze for certain undocumented adults who receive state-funded full-scope Medi-Cal through the Adult Expansion programs. While this freeze will prevent new enrollments for this population, individuals already enrolled in full-scope Medi-Cal will remain eligible as long as they complete their annual renewal on time.

Who is affected

This enrollment freeze applies to adults aged 19 and older who:

Are undocumented or do not have a satisfactory immigration status for federally funded full-scope Medi-Cal.

Receive state-funded full-scope Medi-Cal through the Adult Expansion programs that were created to cover undocumented adults.

This change does not affect children ages 0–18 or pregnant individuals, who may continue to enroll in full-scope Medi-Cal regardless of immigration status. (For pregnant individuals, coverage is for the entire pregnancy and one year after the pregnancy ends.)

What this means for current enrollees

Current members can stay covered regardless of immigration status, but timely annual renewal is essential.

If coverage is lost due to late or incomplete renewal paperwork, affected individuals will generally not be able to re-enroll in full-scope Medi-Cal. They would only remain eligible for emergency or pregnancy-related services.

How providers can support patients

Physicians and other health care providers play a vital role in helping patients maintain uninterrupted coverage. Supporting patients through the Medi-Cal renewal process can help prevent gaps in care and ensure continued access to essential health care services. Here’s how you can help:
