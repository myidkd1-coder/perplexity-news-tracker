In a post on X, the Indian head of government stressed that ongoing diplomatic efforts remain the most viable path to ending hostilities and achieving lasting peace.

He urged all parties involved to remain focused on these efforts and avoid any actions that could undermine them.

Yesterday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reported that, during the night of December 28-29, Ukrainian authorities carried out a terrorist attack using 91 long-range attack drones against Vladimir Putin’s state residence in the Novgorod region.

The Russian Foreign Minister emphasized that all the drones were destroyed by Russian Armed Forces air defense systems and noted that no injuries or damage from falling debris were reported.

He also stressed that the attack took place “during the intense negotiations between Russia and the United States to resolve the Ukrainian conflict.”

During an interview this Tuesday on the Rossiya 1 television channel, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova asserted that Kyiv will face a response for its acts of terrorism.

The high-ranking diplomat stated that “the latest actions of the Ukrainian authorities demonstrate that this is a genuine, bloodthirsty terrorist regime with a neo-Nazi base, but they will receive a response for it.”
