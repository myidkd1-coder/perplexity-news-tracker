## Full Article
If January is for resolutions, it's also for predictions — and in 2026, venture capital is placing its bets on tiny teams, personal agents, and a reckoning for wildly overpriced tech startups.

In recent years, companies dumped money into generative artificial intelligence tools that promised to help them work smarter and faster. The spending spree fattened revenue for companies selling copilots for coding, customer service, sales, and search — and sent their valuations soaring.

Now investors say the next phase is payback. Enterprises will demand measurable returns to keep spending, and the AI companies that can't prove value may find their software renewals harder, fundraising tougher, and exits further away. As Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, put it: "2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI."

Business Insider asked investors at 18 venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures, CapitalG, Sapphire Ventures, and Greycroft to share their predictions for what's next: where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the market to shift in the year ahead.

From IPOs to ROI, these are the tech trends to watch in 2026, according to venture capitalists.
