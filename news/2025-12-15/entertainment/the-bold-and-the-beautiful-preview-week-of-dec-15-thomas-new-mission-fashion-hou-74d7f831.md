The Bold And The Beautiful Preview Week Of Dec 15: Thomas’ New Mission & Fashion House Shocker

The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers reveal a preview clip has been released for the week of December 15, 2025. It shows Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson) returns and wants his old job back.

Meanwhile, Bill Spencer (Don Diamont) gifts Katie Logan (Heather Tom) her own fashion house. Keep reading and let’s talk about what is coming up in the CBS soap opera.

Thomas Forrester’s New Mission

The preview clip begins with Thomas, who has returned to Los Angeles. It was stated by Hope Logan Spencer (Annika Noelle) that Douglas Forrester (Henry Joseph Samiri) was only there for one day on the wedding. However, the preview clip shows Thomas is back in town and wants his old designer job back.

Ridge Forrester’s Support

In light of Eric Forrester (John McCook) retiring, having Thomas back will make Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) really happy. The man has always felt that Thomas belonged there with his family.

However, Hope has already given Deke Sharpe (Harrison Cone) the job as lead designer.

Hope Logan Spencer’s Business Dilemma

The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers reveal that Steffy Forrester Finnegan (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) will try to give Thomas what he wants.

Steffy tells Hope that she can’t refuse to work with Thomas just because he makes her uncomfortable. However, Hope relies that Deke is the one with fresh ideas and wants to see if there is a way she could have both.

However, Steffy says that there is no other way. That will be devastating if Hope has to let Deke go in favor of Thomas. While both men are talented, it doesn’t seem very fair for Deke.

In the past, there were fashion showdowns. I wonder if that will happen for Deke and Thomas. At the same time, I wonder if one will try to play deviously in order to win.

Katie Logan’s Fashion House

As for BATIE, the couple has an exciting new chapter coming up. Bill ends up showing Katie a video presentation. It turns out that Bill’s wedding gift to Katie is her very own fashion house!

This is exciting, but can Katie really handle an entire fashion house on her own? Will Katie end up poaching talent from Forrester Creations?

Fans have been asking for years for the return of fashion house rivalries. It seems like we are finally getting what we want.
