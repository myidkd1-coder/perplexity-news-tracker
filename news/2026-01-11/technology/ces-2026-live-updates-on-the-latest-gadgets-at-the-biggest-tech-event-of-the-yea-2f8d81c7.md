I’ve been trying to publish my hands-on with L'Oréal’s red light masks since I saw it on Tuesday, but between meetings, liveblogging and awards organizing and more, I just haven’t been able to.

So here I am now to tell you all about how they felt on my face. Here’s what I look like with both of them on but just one turned on:

A person with the Loreal LED Eye masks on, with the one under her left eye turned on. It's glowing red.

To be clear, L'Oréal was not letting people put on the LED Face Mask for various sanitary and regulatory reasons, but it was also on display. I was able to put on the under eye masks, and L'Oréal supplied some adhesive patches to put between the masks and my skin.

I found it a bit tricky to get the second one I applied to stay, but the first one stuck on easily and hung tight. It also took me a while to figure out where the power on button was, but once I did, the placement felt intuitive. Not having each of these be connected by cables to a power unit makes them so much easier to use.

After a few minutes, the one I applied first (under my right eye) started to feel warm. I have a lot more thoughts about the product in general, which I’ve already briefly touched on in my initial writeup about the launch.
