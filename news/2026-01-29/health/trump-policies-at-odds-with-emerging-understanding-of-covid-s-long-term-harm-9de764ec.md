KFF Health News: Doctors Increasingly See AI Scribes In A Positive Light. But Hiccups Persist

When Jeannine Urban went in for a checkup in November, she had her doctor’s full attention. Instead of typing on her computer keyboard during the exam, Urban’s primary care physician at the Penn Internal Medicine practice in Media, Pennsylvania, had an ambient artificial intelligence scribe take notes. At the end of the 30-minute visit, Urban’s doctor showed her the AI summary of the appointment, neatly organized into sections for her medical history, the physical exam findings, and an assessment and treatment plan for her rheumatoid arthritis and hot flashes, among other details. (Andrews, 1/27)

KFF Health News: Trump Policies At Odds With Emerging Understanding Of Covid’s Long-Term Harm

Possible risk of autism in children. Dormant cancer cells awakening. Accelerating aging of the brain. Federal officials in May 2023 declared an end to the national covid pandemic. But more than two years later, a growing body of research continues to reveal information about the virus and its ability to cause harm long after initial infections resolve, even in some cases when symptoms were mild.

After Susannah Reed-McCullough’s husband died in 2018, she and their young daughters continued to receive health insurance through his job as a firefighter in Maryland. Then, in 2024, she got an unexpected medical bill: $377 for a checkup for one of her children the previous fall.

"The ENA [Emergency Nurses Association] community mourns Alex Pretti and extends its condolences to his loved ones and his nursing family," ENA President Dustin Bass, RN, DNP, said in a statement. "Nurses play a vital role in their communities not only within the hospital, but anywhere someone needs help. We always try to do what's right for others, using our clinical expertise to care for patients and relying on personal beliefs to show up for people, even beyond the stretcherside." (Frieden and Firth, 1/26)

Axios: ICE Fear Is Keeping Patients From Medical Care, Amid Trump Deployment

The escalation of ICE activity in Minnesota is disrupting care at hospitals and clinics that already were navigating shifting legal standards on immigration enforcement in their facilities.

Modern Healthcare: ICE Activity At Hospitals, Emergency Rooms Is Concerning: AMA

The American Medical Association weighed in Monday about immigration enforcement activities at hospitals and emergency rooms. “The American Medical Association is deeply concerned by reports of immigration enforcement activity in and around hospitals and emergency rooms — a tactic fueling fear among patients and hospital staff alike,“ the organization said in a statement. ”When people are afraid to seek medical attention for themselves or their families, it threatens their health, impedes the ability of physicians to render care, and ultimately undermines basic trust in our health care institutions." (DeSilva, 1/26)

The Washington Post: Republican Drops Bid For Governor, Citing GOP’s ‘Retribution’ On Minnesota

Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney who was running as a Republican for Minnesota governor, said Monday that he was ending his campaign because of the national GOP’s “retribution” on his state, describing Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations there as an “unmitigated disaster.” “United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship — that’s wrong,” Madel said, noting that he had spoken to Hispanic and Asian members of local law enforcement whom immigration officers had stopped. ... "The reality is that the national Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” he said. (Wang, 1/26)

Fierce Healthcare: Government Funding Deal Begins To Unravel As Deadline Looms

Six annual spending bills for the current budget year are awaiting action in the Senate this week, including a key appropriations package that would fund the Department of Health and Human Services through Sept. 30. But the sweeping government funding package is now in peril as Senate Democrats vowed to oppose it in the wake of the shooting death of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents, which would trigger a partial government shutdown. The number of agencies that would be affected by a shutdown remains unclear. (Landi, 1/26)

Compared with his first term in office, Trump has escalated his retreat from global cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (Roston and Kahn, 1/27)

Politico: Republicans Think RFK Jr. Can Help Them In The Midterms. Democrats Worry That’s True.

Republicans have embraced HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s healthy food crusade, hoping it will boost their prospects in the midterms. Some Democrats fear it might work. The health secretary was in Pennsylvania last week, touting a new campaign to “take back” Americans’ health. It was the first of what is expected to be many stops ahead of the midterms where the secretary, a former presidential candidate with a constituency all his own, will tout the administration’s efforts to keep Americans, especially children, healthy. (Haslett and Doherty, 1/27)

MedPage Today: Cardiologists Send RFK Jr. A Wish List On 'Long Overdue' USPSTF Overhaul

Prominent cardiology leaders wrote a letter to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. demanding a "forward-looking" U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) roster that will be willing to adopt the latest science on cardiovascular prevention. The nonprofit Society for Heart Attack Prevention and Eradication (SHAPE) coalition of physicians, scientists, and public health leaders criticized past USPSTF recommendations for lagging "far behind contemporary science and real-world clinical needs."

NBC News: Many CDC Databases Are Not Being Updated, Most Related To Vaccines, Study Finds

Nearly half of the databases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used to update regularly — surveillance systems that tracked public health information like Covid vaccination rates and hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus — have been paused without explanation, according to new research. The findings, published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, indicate that at the start of 2025, the CDC maintained 82 databases that were updated at least monthly.

In the early hours of the morning on June 1, 2025, Katie Gowell went into labor at her home in Patten, a town on the outskirts of Maine’s northern wilderness containing Mount Katahdin, where her family doctor was prepared to deliver her fifth child. Shortly after her water burst, a complication arose: she had a prolapsed umbilical cord, a medical emergency that can cut off the baby’s oxygen supply. Her physician, Dr. Rose Fuchs, quickly intervened to keep the blood flowing and called for an ambulance. (Hedegard, 1/26)

(Monaco, 1/26)

Modern Healthcare: Why Mayo, Cleveland Clinic Are Investing In Pulsed Field Ablation

Health systems are making big investments in pulsed field ablation systems, reasoning that the technology will help expand their cardiac programs and the short-term financial hit quickly will be recouped. Pulsed field ablation has only been available in the U.S. within the past two years.

(Dubinsky, 1/26)

The New York Times: Thomas Fogarty, 91, Who Helped Revolutionize Vascular Surgery, Dies

In time, his surgical innovations were credited with saving millions of lives, and publications hailed him for his supreme skill and accomplishments as the “Thomas Edison” and even the “Mickey Mantle” of medical device inventors.

Julia Sheffield, a psychologist who specializes in treating people with delusions, is difficult to rattle.

By the end of the year, Dr. Sheffield had seen seven such patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. Although she is accustomed to treating people with mental instability, Dr. Sheffield was disturbed that this new technology seemed to tip people from simply having eccentric thoughts into full-on delusions.

And when the testimony was over, no one on the board would make a motion that would result in cuts to the parents’ monthly pay. (Brown, 1/26)

The Washington Post: Man With Dementia Forgot He’s Been Married 40 Years. He Proposed Again

Michael O’Reilley doesn’t always remember his wife’s name when she visits him, or even that she’s his wife at all. “He just knows he loves me,” said Linda Feldman, O’Reilley’s wife of 39 years. “That’s a constant.” O’Reilley, 77, has Alzheimer’s disease. Last November, during a visit at his memory care facility in Berkeley, California, he pulled Feldman close, looked at her and asked her a question she had already answered nearly four decades earlier. “Will you marry me?” he asked. “Yes,” Feldman replied.

The New York Times: The ‘R-Word’ Returns, Dismaying Those Who Fought To Oust It

The use of a hurtful word still considered taboo is emblematic of the provocative language that courses through the manosphere sector of social media these days — almost gleefully transgressive language often adopted in messaging from the White House. Diplomacy is out and mockery in, whether by displaying plaques that insult former presidents, depicting Donald Trump spraying excrement on protesters from a military jet — or using the “R-word” to question the intelligence of a political opponent, as Mr. Trump did in a Truth Social post on Thanksgiving Day, in which he called Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, “seriously retarded.” (Barry and Rao, 1/26)
