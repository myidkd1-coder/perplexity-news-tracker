This blog is now closed. The Lok Sabha on Monday passed first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants, seeking additional spending of Rs 41,455 crore in FY26. Earlier in the day, the Modi government tabled three crucial Bills in the House aiming to open the nuclear power sector to private players, regulate higher education and repealing some redundant laws even as it held back one that seeks to massively tweak the MGNREGA and rename it despite putting it on the day’s agenda. The Rajya Sabha, on the other hand, continued to debate on electoral reforms. Thank you for following this space. Stay tuned to DH for latest updates on Parliament's Winter Session.
