Top Hypepotamus Stories

5 million people have downloaded Atlanta-based Reframe, an app that has a simple mission: Help people drink less. As January gets underway, millions are attempting Dry January, or the annual tradition of abstaining from alcohol for the first month of the year. It’s become somewhat of a collective reset button pushed by people who spent December overindulging at holiday parties and family gatherings. But while the intention is often there, the execution is notoriously difficult. Most people slip within the first two weeks, and many never make it to February 1st. As a data-driven platform tracking millions of users, Reframe knows what it takes to make it through January…and its findings might surprise you. Learn more here.

We spoke to Deliveri up in North Carolina, a startup helping small and up-and-coming ecommerce brands navigate their shipping woes in the wake of tariff changes. Deliveri works as a global shipping platform, or a unified hub for branded tracking, insurance, customer communication, competitive shipping rates, and return services. Those things individually aren’t unique. But Deliveri’s approach of bringing all those services and tools into one platform is. The goal is also to provide smaller, up-and-coming brand-led founders with enterprise-level solutions that have been inaccessible to them previously. As a rate aggregator, for example, Deliveri can help customers find the best courier for their needs, saving up to 90% on shipping costs. More on Deliveri here.
