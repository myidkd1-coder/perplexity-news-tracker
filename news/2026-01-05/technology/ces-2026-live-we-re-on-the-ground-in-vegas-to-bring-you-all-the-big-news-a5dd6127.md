I particularly like the look of the Ceiling Light Ultra, which comes with a 616-pixel LED matrix that can show animated scenes, though I'm slightly concerned that the price will be very expensive. Hopefully we'll get pricing information soon as well. (Image credit: Govee)

It's Matt again (you'll probably see a few of us take turns on this blog), and my colleague John Loeffler is at CES 2026 helping to cover all the computing news that will come out of the huge tech show. As with previous years, we'll be hearing from some of the biggest brands in computing, including Asus, Acer, Nvidia and Intel. (Image credit: Getty Images / Moor Studio) Before that, however, what is John looking forward to seeing at this year's show? Well, you can read his early hopes, which include wanting to see AI (artificial intelligence) features that are actually impressive. Like John, I've so far not been too impressed with AI, despite many companies promising that it will revolutionise our gadgets - and our lives. Hopefully, CES 2026 changes that, as there's no doubt there'll be plenty of talk about AI at Las Vegas this year.

It's not all big-ticket tech at CES – our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has had his hands on a new digital fidget toy with clickable buttons and a collection of pre-installed games. You also get the fun of building it, because it comes as a little kit to keep your hands busy. Check it out! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Samsung Display) Hi there! Homes editor Cat Ellis here, taking over the live blog for a moment to bring you some interesting musings on the latest developments in TV tech. We've seen some very exciting new screens at CES, but our writer Carrie Marshall thinks the latest panels might not be all they seem. New TVs from LG and Samsung promise up to 4,500 nits at peak brightness, but Carrie points out that those results would have been achieved in very specific controlled conditions, so you're not likely to need shades to watch The Night Manager any time soon.

Lance, our Editor-at-Large, is at CES in Las Vegas, and he's been posting some great videos of all the cool gadgets he's seen so far on our TikTok channel. This has led to a nice jump-scare this morning for me as I scrolled our live blog and saw a video of Lance waving a knife around. For a slightly less concerning video, here's Lance testing out what at first looks like one of Tony Stark's prototypes, but is actually a massage chair. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Apple) Morning everyone, it's Matt Hanson, Managing Editor of Core Tech, and I'll be covering CES announcements here for an hour or so. Like my boss, Marc, I am not in warm Las Vegas, but in chilly and slightly snowy Bath, UK, and the image above is an accurate depiction of how I am dressed today. Fraggle-chic, I call it.

Meet the LG C6H… (Image credit: Future) Many of the big announcements so far have been around TVs, with Samsung and LG's efforts in particular standing out. Let's start with LG – because it's making a big change for its almost-flagship 'C' series OLED for 2026, with the C6 coming in not one but two versions. Yes, that's right: you'll be able to buy either the standard C6, or the new C6H model, with the latter using a fancy Primary RGB Tandem panel, as seen in last year's flagship G5 set. This should make for better brightness and color – with the downside being that it'll only be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes. You can get more detail on the new LG C6 and C6H here, and stay tuned for further updates as we get them.

Good morning from the UK. Marc McLaren here, taking over for a post or two – but from cold, snowy London, not warm, sunny Las Vegas.

Beyond the massive TVs – looking at you, Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV – we spotted a unique take on a classic kitchen gadget at CES Unveiled. What looks like a standard knife for cutting vegetables actually uses microvibrations to make slicing and dicing much easier. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We saw the Pebble Round 2 (Image credit: Core Devices) Thanks to a suprise announcement last week, we knew we'd get the chance to see the Pebble Round 2 at CES, and our first look at the new smartwatch has arrived on TechRadar's TikTok. Now back to life thanks to Core Devices, the Pebble Round 2 is boasting an edge-to-edge, round color e-paper display and promises one week of battery life. That's a big difference compared to the other leading smartwatches, and the Round 2 arrives a decade after the previous Round watch hit the market. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Here's one peek behind the scenes, and I bet you'll see it trending on TikTok from folks visiting Samsung's space at The Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas for CES 2026. They set up a sort of tunnel within a ballroom filled with speakers and numerous projectors to change the environment and, at times, immerse you in color. It's really neat and got folks talking before they even saw all the new TVs and other gadgets. I especially like the mirror entrances at the front and back, which give the illusion that this goes on for miles.

Samsung stuns with new TVS – OLED, Frame, and Micro RGB included Samsung's First Look might be wrapped, but TechRadar is the place to be, thanks to our team of experts breaking down all that was unveiled. And the star of the show is a new concept, but one that we viewed with our own eyes – Samsung's new 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It not only stretches farther than the 115-inch model Samsung's been selling since last year, but it can also be wall-mounted or sat on a pretty incredible stand. (Image credit: Future) Similarly, the major-sized 98-inch standard Frame TV ... might well just be the TV of my dreams. Though I'm a bit scared for the eventual price reveal. Meanwhile, Samsung also made some updates to its lineup of OLED TVs. Yes, even with the arrival of Micro RGB TVs in various sizes, Samsung's still offering QLED, Neo QLED, and OLED. Notably, the flagship OLED is brighter, includes a metal stand, and will display works of art via Art Mode. Samsung reveals upgraded OLED TVs and super-sized screens at CES 2026

We'll have more from CES Unveiled shortly, but Samsung's big First Look 2025 event is about to kick off. Given that the tech giant isn't doing a formal keynote this year, this will be Samsung's big presentation. Historically, this has been the place for Samsung to unveil new TVs, home audio, and monitors, but in more recent years, it's all also been about AI, AI, and more AI. Samsung's already teased and even pre-announced some key things – including an expansion of its microRGB lineup – so it'll likely be a full presentation.

First, let's start with one of the first products that stood out to Lance Ulanoff at CES Unveiled. You can see his first look TikTok below, but SkyWheel Peak S is basically a wearable that will let you feel like you're skiing on almost any surface. Pretty neat, I'd say. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar
