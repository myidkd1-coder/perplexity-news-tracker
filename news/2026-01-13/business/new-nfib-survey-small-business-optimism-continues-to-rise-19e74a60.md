WASHINGTON, D.C. (Jan. 13, 2026) – The NFIB Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 points in December to 99.5 and remained above its 52-year average of 98. Of the 10 Optimism Index components, two increased, three decreased, and five were unchanged. An increase in those expecting better business conditions primarily drove the rise in the Optimism Index. The Uncertainty Index fell 7 points from November to 84, the lowest reading since June 2024.

“2025 ended with a further increase in small business optimism,” said NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg. “While Main Street business owners remain concerned about taxes, they anticipate favorable economic conditions in 2026 due to waning cost pressures, easing labor challenges, and an increase in capital investments.”

In conjunction with the December report, NFIB also released a new episode of the “Small Business by the Numbers” podcast. This is the NFIB Research Center’s new podcast where co-hosts Holly Wade, the Executive Director of the NFIB Research Center, and Peter Hansen, Director of Research and Policy Analysis, discuss the data, stories, and economic conditions affecting small businesses nationwide. Listen to the latest episode here.

Key findings include:

Twenty percent of small business owners reported taxes as their single most important problem, up 6 points from November and ranking as the top problem. This is the highest reading since May 2021.

A net negative 3% of owners reported paying a higher interest rate on their most recent loan, down 5 points from November and the lowest reading since January 2021.

The net percent of owners expecting better business conditions rose 9 points from November to a net 24% (seasonally adjusted), contributing the most to the rise in the Optimism Index. This was the first increase since July.

Beneath simple yes/no impact binary, there was a positive shift from those reporting a significant impact to those reporting a moderate or mild impact.

As reported in NFIB’s monthly jobs report, a seasonally adjusted 33% of all small business owners reported job openings they could not fill in December, unchanged from November. Unfilled job openings remain above the historical average of 24%.

Thirteen percent spent money on new fixtures and furniture (up 3 points), and 7% acquired new buildings or land for expansion (up 2 points).
