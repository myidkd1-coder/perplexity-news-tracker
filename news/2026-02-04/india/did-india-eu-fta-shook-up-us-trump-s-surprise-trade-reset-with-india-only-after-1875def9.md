## Full Article
After months of stalled negotiations, the India–US trade breakthrough did not come from pressure, but from leverage. Washington had tied any deal to India ending Russian oil imports. India said no. Talks froze. Then New Delhi signed a sweeping free trade agreement with the European Union, instantly strengthening its global trade position. Markets reacted. And the Trump administration took notice. Days later, Trump announced reduced tariffs on Indian exports, calling the deal immediate. Modi welcomed the 18 percent tariff rate but avoided endorsing US claims on Russian oil or zero tariffs. That gap tells the real story. India has not altered its energy stance, even as the US links tariff relief to curbing Russia’s oil income. With instability in the Gulf and long-term Russian supply contracts in place, India prioritises stability over geopolitics. Politically, both sides claim victory. But strategically, the sequence is clear. The EU deal changed the equation. India held its ground. And the US adjusted first.
