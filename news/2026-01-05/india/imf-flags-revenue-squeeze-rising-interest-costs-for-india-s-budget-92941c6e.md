IMF Projects Fiscal Tightrope for India's Budget

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cast a cautious outlook on India's central government finances, projecting that the forthcoming 2026-27 budget will navigate a challenging fiscal path. The primary headwinds identified are softer revenue generation and mounting interest costs on sovereign debt, demanding a delicate balancing act for policymakers.

Revenue Pressures Mount, Spending Realigned

Government income, measured as a percentage of GDP, is estimated to slightly decline from 9 percent in the current fiscal year to 8.9 percent in 2026-27. Tax collections are expected to hold steady at 7.2 percent of GDP, with non-tax revenues contributing 1.7 percent. The dip in overall revenue is partly attributed to lower tax rates aimed at stimulating consumer spending. To compensate, efforts may intensify to broaden the tax base.

Total government spending is slated for a reduction, falling from 14.1 percent of GDP in 2024-25 to 13.4 percent in 2026-27. Within this consolidated spending, interest payments on loans are set to increase marginally from 3.4 percent to 3.6 percent of GDP. Subsidies are projected to decrease from 1.2 percent to 1.1 percent, and infrastructure spending will see a slight cut, dropping from 3.2 percent to 3 percent of GDP. This recalibration suggests a potential need for innovative funding mechanisms for infrastructure, such as asset monetization or public-private partnerships.

Deficit Narrowing Central, Widening Combined

The fiscal deficit at the central government level is anticipated to improve, decreasing from 4.9 percent of GDP in 2024-25 to 4.5 percent in 2026-27, aligning with the budgeted 4.4 percent for the current fiscal year. The IMF expects no further significant reduction in the deficit in the medium term. Government debt is projected to decrease from 56.2 percent of GDP to 55.4 percent by 2026-27, a positive signal for financial health.

However, when considering both central and state government finances combined, the overall deficit is forecast to rise slightly from 7.1 percent to 7.2 percent of GDP in 2026-27. This could be a contributing factor to persistent high long-term bond yields. Across all government levels, interest payments are expected to climb from 4.8 percent to 5.5 percent of GDP, a development the IMF views with concern, calling for "ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation" to rebuild buffers and support growth-enhancing expenditures.

360° Investment Research Note

Bullish Outlook

Fiscal discipline at the central government level, coupled with a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, offers a positive backdrop for macroeconomic stability. This can enhance India's credit profile, potentially attracting foreign portfolio investment and supporting the Indian Rupee. The potential for asset sales could also unlock value and provide funding for growth initiatives.

Bearish Outlook

The projected slowdown in revenue growth, coupled with rising interest burdens, presents a significant fiscal headwind. A potential decrease in infrastructure spending could dampen economic momentum, negatively impacting sectors like construction, capital goods, and government-dependent enterprises. The widening combined deficit (centre+state) is a key concern for bond markets, potentially keeping borrowing costs elevated.

Skeptical Considerations

The projected revenue figures warrant scrutiny, especially if tax rates are lowered to encourage spending. The reliance on 'creative' funding for infrastructure projects may indicate a slowdown in direct public investment or the potential use of off-balance sheet financing. The IMF's call for more 'ambitious' consolidation suggests current plans might fall short of rebuilding sufficient fiscal buffers.

Data Insights

The data indicates a clear shift in spending priorities, with interest payments increasing as a share of GDP while infrastructure allocation faces minor cuts. The divergence between the central government's improving deficit and the combined deficit's marginal rise highlights the fiscal challenges faced by state governments. The decrease in debt-to-GDP is a slow but positive trend. The critical factor will be the government's ability to achieve revenue targets and manage expenditure effectively against rising borrowing costs.
