Responding to a video circulating on social media allegedly showing the Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar pulling down Nusrat Parveen’s hijab during a government function, Aakar Patel, Chair of Board at Amnesty International India, said:

“This act was an assault on this woman’s dignity, autonomy, and identity. When a public official forcibly pulls down a woman’s hijab, it sends a message to the general public that this behavior is acceptable. No one has the right to police a woman’s faith or clothing.

“Such actions deepen fear, normalize discrimination, and erode the very foundations of equality and freedom of religion. This violation demands unequivocal condemnation and accountability. Urgent steps must be taken to ensure that no woman is subjected to such degrading treatment.”

Background

The footage shows Bihar Nitish gesturing towards Nusrat Parveen’s headscarf before abruptly pulling it down. Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary, who was standing behind him, appears to intervene and restrain the Chief Minister, while Health Minister Mangal Pandey and the Chief Minister’s Principal Secretary, Deepak Kumar, are seen laughing.

Wearing – and not wearing – specific forms of dress and religious and cultural symbols is a component of the right to freedom of expression and to freedom of religion or belief. Each individual should be free to decide whether or not they want to wear specific symbols and dress on the basis of personal religious convictions, cultural customs or for any other reason. The actions allegedly committed by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar against Nusrat Parveen represent a deeply troubling violation of her physical integrity
