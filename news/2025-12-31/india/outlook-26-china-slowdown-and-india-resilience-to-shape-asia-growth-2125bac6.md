SINGAPORE (ICIS)–China’s cooling domestic demand and India’s manufacturing-led acceleration are set to define the Asian economic landscape in 2026, even as the broader global economy navigates a fresh wave of US tariffs and geopolitical volatility.

China GDP growth to slow below 5% in 2026

India to grow between 7.5-7.8% in fiscal year 2025

SE Asia GDP growth to remain resilient in 2026

While the global economy is projected to maintain a moderate growth pace, the divergence between the region’s two largest powers highlights a shifting industrial base.

India is forecasted to expand between 7.5-7.8% in fiscal year 2025, fueled by robust domestic demand and a “China plus one” investment surge.

Conversely, China’s GDP growth is expected to slip below 5% in 2026 as Beijing grapples with a persistent property crisis.

Better-than-expected headline growth has masked a significant slump in China’s domestic consumption. According to Deloitte Global Economics Research Center, the economy remains weighed down by a struggling real estate sector and a soft labor market.

CHINA

Global real GDP expansion is estimated at around 3.1% in 2026, a slight deceleration from the forecast of 3.2% in 2025, amid expectations of slowing economic activity as front-loading of exports ease, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its October outlook.

China’s economy is projected to moderate to 4.5% in 2026, from “around 5%” this year, said Deloitte Global Economics Research Center’s Xu Si Tao in a report from 19 December.

Several factors also contribute to the lowered forecast: The current property downturn in China is expected to run its course in the next 12 months, while “anti-involution” campaign by the government is set to continue, pushing consolidation in “nonstrategic” sectors, such as steel, cement, and solar panels, plagued by overcapacity.

The contribution of net exports to GDP are also expected to diminish following export levels that defied expectations in 2025, rising to 6% this year from 1% in 2024, Xu said.

Trade barriers in the form of tariffs and anti-dumping duties (ADDs) are appearing not just from the US, but also from other countries such as Mexico.

INDIA

Amid trade issues with the US over the import of Russian oil, India has sought to boost domestic demand via several initiatives such as income tax cuts and rationalized goods and services tax rate for items such as automobiles, while suspending Quality Control Order (QCO) requirements under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) for several petrochemical products including vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and vinyl acetate monomer (VAM).

These initiatives, coupled with improving price stability, have led to strong economic activity which should persist into 2026, Rumki Majumdar of Deloitte Global Economics Research Center said.

“Strong growth in the fast-moving consumer goods sector (12.9%) in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 to 2026 and in two-wheeler sales (27%) in November 2025 point toward higher rural consumption,” Majumdar said.

Recent free trade agreements signed with the UK, Oman and New Zealand are expected to further boost exports even as US trade relations remain strained at the time of writing, with an eye on a trade deal expected in January 2026.

India also continues to remain reliant on Chinese materials, with the QCO requirements being rescinded allowing for cheaper imports for producers.

“Deloitte South Asia expects India to grow between 7.5% and 7.8% in fiscal year 2025 to 2026, followed by 6.6% to 6.9% in the subsequent year,” Majumdar added, noting the upbeat assessment “hinges on … underlying structural growth drivers” even as trade uncertainties weigh on export prospects, especially for merchandise.

India’s fiscal year 2025 ends on 31 March 2026.

SE ASIA

Southeast Asia’s growth projections were revised up to 4.5% in 2025 and 4.4% in 2026 amid improved external environment and supportive public spending, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in its December 2025 outlook.

Strong Q3 performances in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam alongside steady growth in Thailand contributed to the revised outlook.

Despite there being several risks to the subregion’s prospects from

global uncertainty, climate-related disruptions, and domestic political developments”, the region remains resilient amid policy support and flexibility in economic strategies.

NE ASIA

Japan’s growth is forecast at 1.1% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, while inflationary pressures are expected to persist, the ADB said.

Though expansionary fiscal policies under new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi may support growth, these policies could exert upward pressure on bond yields and debt sustainability, ADB added.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s GDP growth forecast for 2025 was at 0.9% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026, supported by expectations of stronger domestic demand as well as reduced trade uncertainty, as a trade deal with the US remains in progress.

Robust global demand for semiconductors also helped to offset weakness in other product categories, ADB said.

Taiwan’s GDP growth forecast is at 7.3% in 2025 and 4.0% in 2026, driven by strong AI demand.

However, public and private consumption increased by only around 1%, while global trade shocks and weak trickle-down to wages from the capital-intensive tech sector hit consumer confidence, the ADB said.

The assumption is that the current AI boom can be sustained at least through midyear while trade tensions with the US will ease, which will support exports.
