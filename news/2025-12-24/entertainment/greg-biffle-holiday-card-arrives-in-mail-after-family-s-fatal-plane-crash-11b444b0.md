Help is coming from all sides for "Ned's Declassified" alum Tylor Chase ... and now one of his former costars is stepping up, getting him a motel room to keep him off the streets, at least for the night.

Daniel Curtis Lee, who starred on the Nickelodeon series with Tylor, shared with TMZ an emotional video of him checking Tylor into a Riverside, California motel Tuesday ... after driving about 50 miles from L.A. to meet up with his former costar, who's been living on the streets.
