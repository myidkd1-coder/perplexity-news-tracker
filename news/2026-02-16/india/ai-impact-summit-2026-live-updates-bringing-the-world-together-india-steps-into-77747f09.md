As the first major AI summit hosted in the Global South, the event underscores India’s ambition to shape global AI norms while advancing domestic capacity. Under the IndiaAI Mission, the government has invested Rs 10,372 crore to build a comprehensive AI ecosystem. More than 38,000 GPUs have been onboarded for shared compute access, 12 indigenous foundation models are being developed, and over 30 India-specific AI applications have been approved. Talent development is central, with thousands of undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students supported through targeted initiatives. The summit features participation from more than 45 countries, with prominent leaders including Emmanuel Macron, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Antonio Guterres. A strong US delegation, alongside industry executives from Microsoft, IBM, Zoom, Kyndryl, Adobe, and others, signals expanding international collaboration. Key themes revolve around bridging the AI adoption gap between the Global North and South, building trusted and sovereign tech stacks, promoting ethical governance, and ensuring that AI augments livelihoods rather than displacing them. The AI Impact Expo, spanning over 70,000 square metres, showcases applications across agriculture, healthcare, education, and public services. Through working groups and thematic sessions, the summit aims to produce actionable proposals, including shared compute frameworks and AI commons for public good. At its core, the event positions India as a bridge between innovation and equitable global impact.
