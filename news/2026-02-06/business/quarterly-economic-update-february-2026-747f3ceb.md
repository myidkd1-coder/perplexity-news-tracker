## Summary
US GDP grows solidly into 2026 per Powell; corporate earnings healthy with 75% S&P beats. Consumer sentiment mixed: Michigan up slightly, Conference Board at lowest since 2014 amid labor and purchasing power concerns.

## Full Article
With all the chaos and volatility we saw in 2025, economic data has not changed significantly since our last quarter economic report. Equities and bonds both delivered positive returns. The Federal Reserve’s FOMC dot plot released in December as well as the January Wall Street Journal survey of economists showed no statistically significant changes. For three consecutive quarters the results have remained essentially unchanged.

There is some noise this quarter in the consumer sentiment numbers. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment was slightly improved from December but remains well below (21.3%) its level in January 2025. The Conference Board, on the other hand, showed a marked drop (9.4%) in consumer expectations in January. More discussion of this later.

And most importantly, my forecast for holiday sales was more accurate than the professionals’. Whereas they forecasted a decline, my expectation that the American consumer would spend was realized. Holiday sales growth is reported at 4.1% over last year and rest assured the Mallini family contributed to this growth!

GDP Continues to Grow

The Atlanta Fed produces a preliminary GDP estimate called GDPNOW. On December 23rd the estimate for the fourth quarter of 2025 was growth of 3.0%. On January 26th it was growth of 5.1% as the Mallini family contribution was revealed! On a more serious note, Chairman Powell in his January 28 news conference said, “the economy expanded at a solid pace last year and is coming into 2026 on a firm footing…job creation has been low, but the unemployment rate has stayed low…inflation remains somewhat elevated”.

Corporate Earnings are Healthy

Corporate earnings remain healthy. Through January 30th, 33% of S&P companies have reported. 75% beat forecasts, compared to third quarter 2025 of 77%. These high percentage of “beats” might lead one to conclude that either the economy is far exceeding our expectations or that analysts do a poor job of estimating future performance. Analysts typically issue estimates that are conservative. What is important is that the companies beat the estimate. A sharp increase of “misses” of their conservative estimates would be a real red flag for economic outlook. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the aggregate reported earnings exceeded estimates by 9.1% compared to 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2024. So, the business community remains healthy.

Markets Delivered Positive Returns in Q4 and in 2025
