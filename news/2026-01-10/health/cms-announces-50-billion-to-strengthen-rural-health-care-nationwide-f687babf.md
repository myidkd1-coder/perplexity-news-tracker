CMS Announces $50 Billion in Awards to Strengthen Rural Health in All 50 States

CMS announced that all 50 states will receive awards under the Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program, a $50 billion initiative established under President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cuts legislation (Public Law 119-21) to strengthen and modernize health care in rural communities across the country. In 2026, states will receive first-year awards from CMS averaging $200 million within a range of $147 million to $281 million. This unprecedented federal investment will help states expand access to care in rural communities, strengthen the rural health workforce, modernize rural facilities and technology, and support innovative models that bring high-quality, dependable care closer to home.

CMS Announces Establishment of the Office of Rural Health Transformation

CMS announced the establishment of the Office of Rural Health Transformation (ORHT) within the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS). Following the creation of the Rural Health Transformation (RHT) Program earlier this year under President Trump’s Working Families Tax Cut legislation (Public Law 119-21), CMS has been carrying out this work and has now formally established ORHT within its organizational structure. The office will continue overseeing the RHT Program—a historic, $50 billion initiative to strengthen rural health systems and expand sustainable access to care nationwide.

New CMS LEAD Model Aims to Expand Access to Accountable Care, Improve Health Outcomes

What’s New

The Long-term Enhanced ACO Design (LEAD) Model is the Innovation Center’s next Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model that will focus on reaching more health care providers who have not joined ACOs, with a 10-year pathway to sustainable benchmarks, flexible population-based payments to support team-based care, integrated support for patients with complex care needs, and new waivers and flexibilities to attract beneficiaries and promote preventive care and healthy living.

Why It Matters

LEAD’s improved benchmarking methodology and other design features will support smaller, independent, or rural-based practices and those who serve patients with more complex challenges that have faced financial and administrative obstacles to being in ACOs previously.

What to Expect

LEAD is a 10-year model that will begin January 1, 2027; ACOs can apply to participate in LEAD by responding to a Request for Applications, which will become available beginning in Spring 2026.

CMS Proposed Model Test Would Lower Certain Medicare Part B Prescription Drugs

What’s New

CMS announces the newly proposed Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) Model that would lower costs of drugs covered by Medicare Part B.

Why It Matters

GLOBE would make high-cost Part B drugs more accessible for people with Medicare by reducing their cost sharing for select eligible Part B GLOBE drugs and alleviating financial strain on Medicare and for American taxpayers.

What to Expect

CMS is seeking public comment on GLOBE by February 23, 2026; see the proposed rule.

More Information:

CMS Proposed Model Test Would Lower Drugs Costs for Medicare Part D

What’s New

CMS announces the newly proposed Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) Model that would lower net costs of certain prescription drugs covered by Medicare Part D to reflect prices paid in economically comparable countries.

Why It Matters

GUARD would help make critical prescriptions more accessible for people with Medicare Part D, better enabling them to follow their prescribed care for optimal health outcomes, and alleviating financial strain on Medicare.

What to Expect

CMS is seeking public comment on GUARD by February 23, 2026; see the proposed rule.

CMS BALANCE Model Aims to Expand Access to GLP-1 Medications for People with Medicare Part D & Medicaid

What’s New

Under the BALANCE Model, CMS negotiates drug pricing with manufacturers of GLP-1 medications on behalf of state Medicaid agencies and Medicare Part D plans to enable people to improve their long-term health, potentially preventing chronic disease and disability.

Why It Matters

GLP-1 drugs are a promising tool to help people with weight loss and improve their overall health, but access to these drugs is uneven because coverage under Medicare and Medicaid is limited.

What to Expect

CMS is issuing a Request for Applications, soliciting drug manufacturers to participate in negotiations. BALANCE will launch in Medicaid in 2026 as participating states can join the model on rolling basis, from May – December. The Balance Model is anticipated to start in Medicare Part D in January 2027. Prior to the launch of the BALANCE Model, CMS plans to implement a separate Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration beginning July 2026 that will serve as a short-term bridge to the BALANCE Model.

Transparency in Coverage Proposed Rule

Consistent with the President’s Executive Order 14221, “Making America Healthy Again by Empowering Patients with Clear, Accurate, and Actionable Healthcare Pricing Information,” on December 19, 2025, CMS, in partnership with the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury jointly proposed changes to the payer price transparency regulations to improve the accessibility of pricing disclosures to participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees, and the standardization and reliability of the public pricing disclosures from non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group and individual health insurance coverage.
