The biggest winner was Kendrick Lamar who took home five awards, including a second consecutive Record of the Year. Olivia Dean won Best New Artist while Billie Eilish and producer/brother Finneas won Song of the Year for ‘Wildflower’. Australia musician Kevin Parker of Tame Impala won Best Dance/Electronic Recording for ‘End of Summer’.

Heavy metal pioneers Deep Purple have announced their 24th album, tentatively due for release in June. Singer Ian Gillian revealed in a recent interview that the band were in the late stages of recording the new album, Deep Purple’s first since 2024’s ‘=1’.

For fans of late ‘90s Aussie reality singing show ‘Popstars’, the original members of Bardot are reuniting for a one-off gig. Sally Polihronas, Katie Underwood, Belinda Chapple, and Tiffani Wood are getting back together to perform at the inaugural Mighty Hoopla festival in Sydney later this year. No word yet as to whether or not Sophie Monk will be joining them.

Organisers of the world famous Sydney Mardi Gras party has announced this year’s event has been cancelled and the festival scaled back in 2026. Mardi Gras chief executive Jesse Matheson revealed the post-parade party – which attracts more than 10,000 people – costs $2 million to put on and has been in deficit since 2020. A number of other festival events have also been cancelled in an effort to stabilise the organisation, Matheson said.

Legendary singer-songwriter and Australian Crawl frontman James Reyne has postponed upcoming anniversary shows to undergo urgent treatment for skin cancer.

“By way of explanation as to why we’ve moved some of the ‘Fall Of Crawl’ shows, I’ve had a Basal Cell Carcinoma diagnosed on the skin under my left eye, a consequence of a lifetime in the sun,” Reyne said in a statement.

“It needs to be surgically removed and involves a recovery period of a couple of weeks, so it’s meant that we’ve had to reschedule a few of the gigs.”

His diagnosis reinforces the importance of sun safety in Australia. All the best to James for a speedy recovery.

Post-apocalyptic thriller ‘28 Years Later: The Bone Temple’, the fourth instalment in the ’28 Days Later’ franchise, has been pulled from cinemas ahead of schedule in light of poor box office performance. Although ’28 Years Later’ last year earned more than $200 million, the sequel has taken in less than a third of that. The film was removed from thousands of cinemas, including in Australia where it is now showing at only a few locations nationally.

Embracing a new chapter of artistry as a band, The Amity Affliction announce their long-awaited new studio album, ‘House Of Cards’. Released via Pure Noise Records on Friday 24 April, ‘House Of Cards’ is the first full-length outing from The Amity Affliction to feature clean vocalist Jonny Reeves, who became a permanent addition to the lineup in 2025. The album’s titular first single is available now.

Just ahead of their extensive Green Electric Tour, which kicks off in a few weeks, two of Australia’s most accomplished voices in rock, Dallas Frasca & Sarah McLeod have joined forces on new track ‘Til It’s Gone’, available now.

Produced by Frasca, along with mixing from Andy Baldwin (Björk, Car Seat Headrest, The Cat Empire) and mastering from Lachlan Carrick,‘Til It’s Gone’ is a perfect balance of both iconic voices – showcasing their powerful range as they wail over the top of a bluesy, classic rock backing. The single comes as the two prepare to hit the road on their 15-date Green Electric Tour across the country.
