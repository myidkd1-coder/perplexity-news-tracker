Brussels, NATO HQ, 21–22 January 2026 – The 194th NATO Military Committee in Chiefs of Defence session took place at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. The Chair of the NATO Military Committee (CMC), Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the 32 Allied Chiefs of Defence and the two Strategic Commanders, General Grynkewich and Admiral Vandier, met to discuss how NATO, from a military standpoint, can address the security challenges and opportunities of the current global security environment.

Admiral Cavo Dragone highlighted that this week’s discussions held three main conclusions. First: “The Alliance is united. We may have robust exchanges of views, at times, but I saw a clear and distinctive convergence: on the military threats we face, and on the direction of travel we must undertake.” Next: “The Alliance is resilient. We are absorbing shocks and learning fast, so we are ready in this demanding environment.” Finally: “The Alliance is dynamic, not static; we are adapting, because we must, in order to deliver on our core tasks,” he stated.

The two-day session included briefings and meetings on various topics from the top military leaders across the Alliance, including dedicated sessions on the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s assessment of readiness, deterrence, and defence, as well as the Supreme Allied Commander Transformation’s views on how NATO is accelerating the delivery of key capabilities. Additionally, the Allies focused on partnerships, including the NATO-Ukraine Council, and engagement with Indo-Pacific partners and Georgia.

During the session, CMC also emphasized the following message: “To the citizens of the Alliance. Security involves everyone. It is not only a matter for politicians, or for the military of the 32 Allies and this Committee that represents them. It concerns every family, every community, and every workplace. That is why we need not only support, but real engagement from the more than a billion people we are committed to defend.”
