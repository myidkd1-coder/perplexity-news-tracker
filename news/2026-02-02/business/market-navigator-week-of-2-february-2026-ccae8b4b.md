Tech companies diverge on earnings

The US equity market retreated towards the end of last week after establishing new highs. The S&P 500 gained 0.3% whilst the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones declined 0.2% and 0.4% respectively. Smaller companies represented by the Russell 2000 index retreated the most (–2.0%) following outperformance earlier in the month.

Healthcare insurers suffered the steepest declines after the US government proposed only a 0.09% increase in reimbursement rates for private insurance plans in 2027, compared to a 5.06% increase for 2026. If confirmed, this policy shift would significantly pressure health insurers' profitability. Humana emerged as the worst-performing S&P 500 constituent, plunging 26.8% last week, whilst UnitedHealth declined 19.5%.

Corporate earnings drove performance divergence amongst technology companies. SanDisk soared 21.6% as fourth-quarter revenue surged 61% year-on-year (YoY), driven by artificial intelligence (AI) data centre demand for NAND flash memory. Microsoft shed 7.7% on increasing capital expenditure and marginally disappointing Azure cloud growth. Meta, another Magnificent 7 company, rallied 8.8% after revising its 2026 sales projection upwards, alleviating concerns surrounding its ambitious AI spending plans.

The technical chart exhibits a double-top formation after the US Tech 100 was rejected at 26,218. The relative strength index (RSI) continues to display bearish divergence. Both indicators point towards a subdued near-term outlook. Should the index fail to hold above the 50-day moving average (MA) and close inside or below the Ichimoku cloud, it would constitute a bearish signal, potentially targeting the cloud's lower boundary near 24,800. Until the index reclaims the 25,850 pivot on a closing basis, establishing new historical highs appears unlikely in the near term.
