An opinion piece assesses India’s foreign policy performance in 2025, arguing that India’s role has been diminished in the US National Security Strategy and reviewing diplomatic setbacks over the year.

## Full Article
The year 2025 ended as a year of failures and defeats in Indian foreign policy as New Delhi faced a barrage of diplomatic setbacks at the global level, reported 24NewsHD TV channel on Saturday.

Expectations in India related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi failed to materialize.

Indian newspaper The Hindu described 2025 as a year of broken promises in the country's foreign policy due to failure to meet expectations.

According to The Hindu, symbolic diplomacy, personal relationships and narrative-building could not prove to be a substitute for real economic, military and diplomatic power.

According to The Hindu newspaper, India made promises not only to itself but also to its partners that it did not have the influence and power to implement.

On relations with the US, The Hindu newspaper says that 2025 has proven to be the most difficult year for India this century.

The 25 percent tariff, additional restrictions on Russian oil and H-1B visa bans have proven that India's partnership with Washington is conditional and self-serving.

According to The Hindu newspaper, India has been reduced to a limited role in the US National Security Strategy 2025 compared to 2017.

Despite all the high-level meetings regarding China and Russia, no tangible security progress could be made on the Line of Actual Control.

Investment barriers remained and India remained limited to a mere symbolic presence.

In the energy sector, The Hindu newspaper clarified that India backtracks on Russian oil deal under US pressure.

The Hindu newspaper calls Pahalgam false flag operation a serious security failure.

It was also admitted that there was no global diplomatic support for Indian military operations after the Pahalgam attack.

The silence on aircraft losses after the Indian operation damaged India's reputation.

The announcement of the Saudi-Pakistan bilateral defence agreement was an additional blow to India.

According to The Hindu newspaper, Indian analysts now consider Pakistan's leadership to be "tough and capable of organizing".

The Hindu newspaper admits that India-Bangladesh relations have reached their highest level ever.

Finally, The Hindu newspaper warns that India is moving away from the "Vishu Guru" narrative and towards the "Vishu Victim" one.

According to the newspaper, India's blaming of others is the biggest obstacle to reform and realistic policymaking.

According to experts, The Hindu newspaper has exposed India's weak diplomacy.

India must understand that only showy diplomacy cannot achieve practical results.

The newspaper's admission of diplomatic failure confirms Pakistan's position that India's foreign policy is mostly based on optics, not practical results.

This analysis by The Hindu newspaper indicates the fact that India is no longer an indispensable strategic partner for the United States.

This point reinforces Pakistan's position that India's deterrence narrative has failed to convince at the global level.

The newspaper's admission that some countries supported Pakistan's military operations has exposed India's diplomatic failure.

The Indian newspaper The Hindu's admission of the capabilities of the Pakistani leadership negates the Indian claim that Pakistan is weak or isolated on the global level.

India, which has expressed concern over the atrocities on minorities in Bangladesh, must condemn and prevent such attacks on minorities in its own country.
