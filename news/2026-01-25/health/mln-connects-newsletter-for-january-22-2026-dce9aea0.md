DMEPOS: Updated List of Items Potentially Subject to Conditions of Payment

CMS added 18 items to the Master List of DMEPOS Items Potentially Subject to Conditions of Payment. We didn’t remove any items.

If CMS selects these items for face-to-face encounter, written order prior to delivery, or prior authorization, you may be required to do one or both:

Meet with your patient and give them a written order before delivering the item

Ask your Medicare Administrative Contractor to authorize the item in advance

Evaluation and Management Services & Intravitreal Injections: Bill Correctly

In a report, the Office of the Inspector General found that Medicare providers improperly billed for evaluation and management (E/M) services provided on the same day as intravitreal injections using modifier 25. Only a significant and separately identifiable E/M service unrelated to the decision to perform the minor surgical procedure should be separately reported with modifier 25.

Learn when to use modifier 25 to prevent improper payments:

Vagus Nerve Stimulation National Coverage Determination: Removing National Edit for Diagnosis Code G47.33

CMS incorrectly added ICD-10 diagnosis code G47.33 (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) as a covered indication for CPT code 64568 under National Coverage Determination (NCD) 160.18. This NCD is specific to vagus nerve stimulation for medically refractory partial onset seizures for whom surgery is not recommended or for whom surgery has failed and treatment-resistant depression. It is unrelated to obstructive sleep apnea; coverage of this diagnosis code falls under your Medicare Administrative Contractor’s (MAC’s) discretion and isn’t mandated by the NCD.

Your MAC will adjust affected claims.
