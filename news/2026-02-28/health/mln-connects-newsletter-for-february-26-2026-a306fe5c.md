Trump Administration Prioritizes Affordability by Announcing Major Crackdown on Health Care Fraud

On February 25, at the White House, Vice President J.D. Vance, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz announced new steps to crack down on fraud in Medicare and Medicaid to protect patients and taxpayers and improve affordability. The actions include deferring $259.5M of quarterly federal Medicaid funding in Minnesota to prevent payment of questionable claims while further investigation is completed; a nationwide moratorium on Medicare enrollment for certain DMEPOS suppliers; and a nationwide call to action for Americans to support fraud prevention, including stakeholder input on how CMS can continue to expand and strengthen its efforts. Together, these steps reflect a coordinated, data-driven strategy to prevent fraud before it occurs, hold bad actors accountable, and protect taxpayer dollars.

MAC MBI Lookup Tool: Keep Your Access During Enhanced Monitoring

CMS identified a concerning trend of malicious actors stealing MBIs and using them to commit Medicare fraud. Some are misusing Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) MBI lookup tools. We’re implementing enhanced monitoring controls to prevent this abuse.

What You Need to Know

Only use the MAC MBI lookup tool for people you intend to provide a service or product to that you’ll bill to Medicare. Our enhanced monitoring compares the MBIs you look up against actual claims submitted with NPIs. If we notice an unusually high rate of MBI lookups without associated claims, your access to the lookup tool may be removed.

Take Action to Maintain Access: Complete MAC Portal Updates by May 7

Make sure your MAC portal users are associated with NPIs in your organization on whose behalf they may perform MBI lookups. This helps us verify legitimate use and protects your access to the lookup tool.

Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice: Get Updated Version in English & Spanish

The Office of Management and Budget approved the updated Medicare Outpatient Observation Notice (MOON), effective now through February 28, 2029. Get the updated version in English and Spanish on the Beneficiary Notices Initiative webpage. CMS improved the readability and design.

You must use the updated notices starting April 21, 2026. We’ll accept the expired and updated versions through April 20, 2026.

You’re required to provide patients MOONs to inform them that they’re outpatients receiving observation services and aren’t inpatients of a hospital or critical access hospital. See the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Chapter 30 (PDF), section 400 for more information.

Laboratories: Paper Fee Coupons & CLIA Certificates Ending March 1

CMS is improving the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program by switching to electronic fee coupons and CLIA certificates. After March 1, 2026, paper fee coupons and CLIA certificates will no longer be available; we’ll stop mailing paper versions after this date. In addition, you must pay your CLIA certification and survey fees online; checks will no longer be accepted.

This is the last chance for eligible laboratories and providers that perform laboratory testing to sign up for CMS email notifications to receive electronic CLIA fee coupons and certificates. Failure to switch may result in billing and certification issues.

You can switch to electronic notifications from CMS or update your email address by:

Emailing your state agency (PDF)

Contacting your Accreditation Organization if you’re an accredited laboratory

Note: This doesn’t apply to CLIA-exempt states.

Hypoglossal Nerve Neurostimulator: New Codes, Effective January 1, 2026

CMS is aware of questions regarding coding for hypoglossal nerve neurostimulators for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and concerns that the current CPT codes don’t accurately describe some newer hypoglossal nerve neurostimulators.

To address this issue, we’ll add 6 new HCPCS codes to the April 2026 Integrated Outpatient Code Editor, effective January 1, 2026:

C8007: Open implantation of hypoglossal nerve neurostimulator array and pulse generator, not requiring insertion of a separate distal respiratory sensor electrode or electrode array C8008: Revision or replacement of hypoglossal nerve neurostimulator array including connection to existing pulse generator C8009: Removal of hypoglossal nerve neurostimulator array and pulse generator C8011: Open implantation of hypoglossal nerve(s) neurostimulator electrode array(s) and receiver, including external power source and all system components C8012: Revision or replacement of hypoglossal nerve(s) neurostimulator electrode array(s) and receiver C8013: Removal of hypoglossal nerve(s) neurostimulator electrode array(s) and receiver

Therapy Services: CY 2026 KX Modifier Threshold Amounts

The CY 2026 KX modifier threshold amount is $2,480 for:

Physical therapy and speech-language pathology services combined

Occupational therapy services

Screening for Hepatitis C Virus National Coverage Determination: Clarified Billing Requirements

CMS clarified billing requirements for the Screening for Hepatitis C Virus in Adults National Coverage Determination 210.13. We’ll pay for HCPCS code G0567 with modifier QW when billed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) waived laboratories and without modifier QW when billed by non-CLIA waived laboratories, effective retroactive to June 27, 2024.

There’s no change to the policy. Your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) will adjust claims you bring to their attention.

See the instruction to your MAC (PDF) for more information.

Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Database: April Update

See the instructions to your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) (PDF) to learn about the April quarterly updates to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Database, including:

New codes

Procedure status changes

Short descriptor code revisions

Payment policy indicator changes

Your MAC will give you 30-days notice before they implement these changes. After that, they’ll adjust claims that you bring to their attention.
