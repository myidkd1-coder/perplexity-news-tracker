Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will undertake his first official visit to India from February 27 to March 2, 2026, at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with the trip focused on business engagements, strategic partnership review and talks on trade, investment, energy and innovation, the Ministry of External Affairs said.On 27 February, Carney will arrive in Mumbai. Over the next two days, he will participate in separate business engagements, interact with Indian and Canadian CEOs, industry and financial experts, innovators, educators as well as Canadian Pension Funds based in India.Carney will arrive in New Delhi on March 1st. On 2nd March, the two Prime Ministers will hold delegation-level talks at Hyderabad House. Both leaders will review the progress achieved till date across diverse areas of the India – Canada Strategic Partnership, building on their earlier meetings in Kananaskis (June 2025) and Johannesburg (November 2025).They will also take stock of ongoing cooperation in key pillars including trade and investment; energy; critical minerals; agriculture; education, research, and innovation; and people-to-people ties. The two leaders will also exchange views on regional and global developments. Modi and Carney will also attend the India–Canada CEOs Forum scheduled later in the day.Carney's visit also signals a significant turn from the strained relations of just a year ago. In 2024, Canada expelled six Indian officials, alleging involvement in campaigns of violence and intimidation against Canadian citizens, following then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s statement that there was credible evidence linking India to the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia.Since Carney succeeded Trudeau, efforts have been made to mend ties.
