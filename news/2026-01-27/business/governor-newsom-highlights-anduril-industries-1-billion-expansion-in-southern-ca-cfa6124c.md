California’s aerospace & defense leadership

California is home to one-third of the nation’s space technology companies and employs more aerospace engineers and defense personnel than any other state. An “accelerate” sector under the California Jobs First Blueprint launched by Governor Newsom, the state’s aerospace & defense sector is underpinned by an incredibly experienced workforce, world-class infrastructure and strong public-private investment, contributing an estimated $35 billion annually to California’s gross domestic product (GDP).

California is not only a national economic powerhouse — it is driving the future. The state is one of the world’s largest economies, feeds the country and leads the nation in new business starts, venture capital investment, manufacturing, and agriculture. With an increasing population and record-high tourism spending, California’s economy continues to grow across key regions and sectors — proving that innovation and inclusion go hand in hand.
