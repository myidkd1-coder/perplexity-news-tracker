## Full Article
Donald Trump’s invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to join the Gaza “Board of Peace” marks a significant diplomatic moment for India. Describing the plan as a bold new approach to global conflict, Trump positioned India as a country capable of delivering stability where force has failed. The board will supervise Gaza’s governance during a fragile transition phase following the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. India has not responded yet, and reports of financial entry requirements have been dismissed by the White House. The decision will hinge on national interest, timing and principle. With India-US trade ties under strain and tariffs escalating, the outreach shows that strategic relevance can coexist with disagreement. Ajay Banga’s role on the board reinforces India’s quiet influence through expertise rather than posturing. In a region defined by volatility, India is increasingly seen as a stabiliser, not a spectator.
