Market Underperformance Fuels 2026 Concerns

Indian equities delivered a disappointing 2% return in U.S. dollar terms during 2025, a stark contrast to the robust 35% surge experienced by emerging markets. This significant underperformance occurred despite India showcasing strong economic growth and achieving record-low inflation, a phase often described as a "goldilocks" economy. Compounding the market's woes, the Indian rupee became one of the weakest performing major currencies globally.

Geopolitical Tensions Drive Foreign Investor Exodus

Escalating geopolitical tensions played a crucial role in deterring foreign investment. The United States imposed substantial sanctions, visa restrictions, and punitive 50% tariffs on Indian imports following India's purchase of Russian oil. Remarks from influential U.S. senators further rattled market sentiment. Consequently, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) withdrew a staggering ₹2.4 lakh crore from Indian secondary market equities in 2025. This outflow drove foreign holdings to a 15-year low of approximately 16.6%.

Global Headwinds Loom Large for 2026

The outlook for 2026 is shadowed by increasing global challenges. Countries are escalating defense spending amid fading trust in security guarantees, with projections suggesting a significant rise in defense budgets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued warnings regarding unsustainable global sovereign debt levels, exacerbated by large deficit-funded government issuances. Simultaneously, developed markets are experiencing a sharp rise in sovereign bond yields, creating a less attractive environment for equity investments.

Domestic Challenges and the Reform Imperative

Domestically, India grapples with issues such as youth unemployment, a 40-year low in household financial savings, rising economic disparity, and declining job quality. Amidst these pressures and upcoming state elections, the government is urged to push for bold reforms. While 2025 saw momentum with eased labor laws and relaxed mining regulations, the author emphasizes the urgent need to channel corporate cash hoards into productive use. Reviving "animal spirits" and lifting nominal GDP growth above 12% are critical.

Future Outlook Hinges on Policy Action

Despite foreign investors holding substantial short positions on Indian equities, many analysts anticipate a bullish outcome driven by projected mid-teen earnings growth and strong corporate balance sheets. However, the core message is clear: without decisive government reforms to address structural issues and boost investor confidence, 2026 risks becoming another "damp squib" for Indian financial assets. The author, Jitendra Gohil, CIO – listed equities at Bajaj Alternate Investment Management, stresses that macroeconomic stability alone does not guarantee stock market returns when geopolitics and policy inaction prevail.

Impact

This news carries significant implications for the Indian stock market, investor sentiment, and foreign capital inflows. The author's analysis highlights the delicate balance between economic fundamentals, geopolitical risks, and the critical role of policy reforms in determining market performance. An inability to enact necessary reforms could lead to sustained underperformance and volatility, impacting wealth creation for domestic investors and the country's overall economic trajectory.
