## Full Article
The gaggle of Youth Congress workers who stripped shirtless in an embarrassing moment at the India AI Impact Summit Friday, and rushed about waving t-shirts and shouting slogans denouncing the India-US tariff agreement, came 'fully prepared', government sources told NDTV.

Ten of them have been arrested already and the rest will be tracked down - with help from facial recognition technology - and held to account, sources said this afternoon.

Four of those arrested have been identified so far.

They are Krishna Hari, the Indian Youth Congress' National Secretary; Narasimha Yadav, the organisation's National Coordinator; and Kundan Yadav and Ajay Kumar, office-bearers from its Bihar and Uttar Pradesh units.

The protesters entered the summit as thousands have over the past five days - after registering with event security and displaying QR codes containing their entry passes. Once inside, the shirts came off.
