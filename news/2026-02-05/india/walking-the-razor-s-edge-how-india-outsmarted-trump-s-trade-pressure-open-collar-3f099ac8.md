India Can Wait Out Trump: Ajit Doval Warned Marco Rubio Against Bullying On Trade Deal, Says Report

A firm Indian message reshaped the tone of India-US trade talks. Bloomberg reports that NSA Ajit Doval told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that India would not accept bullying tactics from President Donald Trump and could wait out his term if needed. The warning came as relations hit a low point following punitive US tariffs and sharp rhetoric from Washington. Doval’s outreach sought to reset ties while drawing clear red lines on sovereignty and strategic autonomy. The approach appeared to work, with renewed leader-level engagement and eventual tariff rollbacks announced by Trump. Still, India has not confirmed the sweeping claims made by the US President on market access and purchases. Officials underline that while the US remains a key strategic partner, India’s long-term interests outweigh short-term pressure. The message from New Delhi is unambiguous: dialogue yes, diktats no.
