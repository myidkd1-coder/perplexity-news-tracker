Notably, 12 components of the 30-stock index ended in positive territory while 18 ended in negative territory. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished at 22,682.73, sliding 0.3% owing to the weak performance by software bigwigs.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to finish at 6,861.89. However, seven out of 11 broad sectors of the broad-market index ended in the positive territory, while four ended in the negative zone. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) rose 1.9% and 1%, respectively. On the other hand, the utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively.
