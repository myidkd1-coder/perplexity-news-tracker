## Summary
Explores Java's future direction, latest LTS benefits, and steady platform improvements. Covers JEP 525 for concurrency, Java 26 updates, AI in development, and Kotlin news.

## Full Article
February is a strange little month. Short, quiet, and typically uneventful. There are fewer distractions and fewer launches, which makes it the ideal time to slow down and take a look at what is actually driving the tech world at the moment.

This issue leans into that calm, with Trisha Gee joining us as our featured content guest and sharing her thoughts and observations on the latest Java news and how it’s shaping developers’ lives. We explore where Java is heading next, what running on the latest LTS really means, and how the platform keeps improving without chasing hype. Add in some practical tutorials, Kotlin updates, AI gradually becoming capable of more and more everyday development tasks, and a few thoughtful takes along the way, and you have a February read that is relaxed in tone, but rich in ideas.

Let’s go!

Happy February, dear readers of Java Annotated Monthly! For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the words “Happy” and “February” do not usually go together. However, I do see the upside of the dark months of January and February, mostly in that things are fairly quiet, travel (for me) is usually limited, and it’s a time to take stock of how you want the rest of the year to go.

So let’s look at Java (weird, for a Java newsletter). We now know the list of features coming in Java 26. Java 25, the current version, is the latest LTS, so although you may not be ready to look at Java 26 yet, you should be running on Java 25. It’s incredible to me that Java is still evolving after all these years, and in elegant and useful ways. In Data-Oriented Programming for Java: Beyond Records, Brian Goetz talks about how data can best be represented in Java, and specifically what carrier classes are. I’m always fascinated by how the language evolves and how the engineers decide which features to add or update (like records or carrier classes). If you are too, you should watch this interview with Georges Saab. He also talks about the value of learning (I learned fairly recently that “Hello World” in Java is much simpler to write thanks to new language features). Watch Marit demonstrate them in IntelliJ IDEA. And if you are keen to expand your IntelliJ IDEA/JetBrains IDE knowledge to expert level, maybe you’ll be interested in JetBrains’ Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA full-day workshop, which is led by me!

I mentioned travel earlier in this piece – sadly I will not be going to JavaOne this year, which is super disappointing. JavaOne is where I got started with presenting at conferences, and it’s a place where I always meet interesting people, whether they are speakers, engineers working on Java itself, Java Champions, Java User Group leaders, or attendees there to learn something new. Tickets are still available, so I recommend taking a look.

That’s all from me! Remember, February is short, and it’ll be spring soon.
