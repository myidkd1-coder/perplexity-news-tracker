Google System updates include wallet and safety features

Over the last few months, the tech giant has deployed a number of features to its phones that have been praised for their innovation and security.

Namely, Google has recently opened its doors to Quick Share with Apple products like AirDrop, allowing Android users to have better connections with all cell phone users.

Heading into February, Google Play services (v25) saw three updates released, all of which target different areas of your Android activity.

Update v26.04 was the first of these, which targeted management systems, including streamlining the device setup process, better Account storage facilities, and a new developer feature.

A week later, the version five update targeted the wallet, adding more supported passports for the ID Pass.

Android Auto and Wear services, Pixel watch, for example, also got a small tweak that allows you to ‘control the transit data display’ on Google Maps.

Finally, the 26.06 update on February 16 improved the earthquake alerts in the Safety & Emergency section and updated the system to improve battery life, storage, and network optimization for anyone with an Android phone.

Is Android finally better than Apple iOS?

Recent updates from Google have been a major success, but the same can be said for Apple, too.

Thankfully, Android has built up a loyal customer base, and many have doubled down on their stance, despite the new iOS overhaul.

With the likes of Samsung launching a revolutionary creaseless foldable phone and a new Blackberry-esque Android hitting like it’s 2008 all over again, Google’s role in supporting them has never been more important.

Ultimately, with Google partnering with Apple to merge many features into one, it’s likely not going to matter what product you’re running in the future.

But for now, the Google System updates show off small wins across the board that continue to make Android users’ lives better.
