Reports, Studies & Analyses

On January 13, 2026, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report entitled, The Opioid Crisis: Federal Policy Approaches to Reduce Supply, Demand, and Harm. CBO analyzed federal policy approaches aimed at addressing the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S., focusing on how different strategies could reduce opioid misuse, overdoses, and mortality while assessing associated budgetary effects. The report identifies three broad categories of federal interventions: (1) efforts to prevent misuse; (2) policies to expand access to treatment and recovery services; and (3) measures intended to reduce harm and overdose deaths. For prevention, CBO considered interventions such as prescription monitoring programs and education campaigns that aim to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing and discourage initial misuse. For treatment domain, CBO discussed policies to broaden access to medication-assisted treatment and examined behavioral health services for their potential to improve recovery outcomes. Finally, harm-reduction strategies — including wider availability of overdose-reversing medications like naloxone and support for syringe service programs — were assessed for their ability to decrease fatal overdoses and transmission of infectious diseases. CBO’s analysis also includes data trends related to opioid-involved overdose deaths, providing context for how the crisis has evolved in recent years.

On January 15, 2026, the RAND Corporation released a report entitled, Clarity and Consistency in Government-Funded Implementation Strategies Associated with Greater Evidence-Based Practice Reach. The report examined how differences in government funding strategies affect the implementation reach of evidence-based practices (EBPs) within publicly funded substance use treatment initiatives. Using a mixed-method comparative case study of 19 U.S. states funded to implement the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (A-CRA)—an evidence-based intervention for youth substance use—the researchers analyzed variations in how extensively certified providers delivered the practice. The study found that states with greater clarity, specificity, and intentionality in implementation requirements and stronger efforts to address common barriers (such as provider turnover and leadership support) tended to achieve higher EBP reach than states with less structured strategies. The findings suggest that more consistent and explicit implementation planning in government-funded initiatives may improve the delivery of evidence-based services.

Hearings & Markups

Other Health Policy News

On January 13, 2026, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) released its Reconciliation 2.0 Framework, outlining proposed reforms for a future reconciliation bill. The measure would follow the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which passed on July 4, 2025. Reconciliation allows certain budget-related legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding the usual 60‑vote threshold.



The framework proposes implementing site-neutral policies on hospital Medicaid billing. It also includes provisions such as public charge rule codification; further restrictions on immigrants’ ability to access public benefits; changing population-based federal disbursements to reflect only citizens; and changes to health plan availability and health savings accounts (HSAs).

On January 14, 2026, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), an HHS agency, reinstated nearly $2 billion in substance use disorder recovery and mental health grants that had been abruptly canceled the previous day. Roughly 2,000 organizations received the initial termination notices, in which SAMHSA stated that it was “adjusting its discretionary award portfolio, which includes terminating some of its awards, in order to better prioritize agency resources.”

On January 15, 2026, President Trump released a health care proposal—“The Great Health Plan”—which urges Congress to pass legislation to reduce prescription drug prices, lower insurance premiums, and require more price transparency from insurance companies, hospitals, and physicians. Specifically, the proposal calls on Congress to codify the Administration’s voluntary Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) drug pricing deals, which ensure Americans pay no more than other nations with similar economies for certain prescription drugs. The proposal also calls for funding the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program within the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which CBO reports will reduce the most common ACA Marketplace plan premiums by over 10 percent.



The proposal also calls on insurance companies to publish rate and coverage comparisons on their websites in “plain English”; publish rate and coverage comparisons upfront; and disclose how much of revenues go towards paying claims versus overhead costs and profits. Finally, the proposal requires any provider or insurer who accepts Medicare or Medicaid to post their pricing and fees and ensure insurance companies are complying with price transparency requirements.

On January 15, 2026, a bill extending the Acute Hospital Care at Home (AHCAH) waivers for five years was hotlined in the Senate. Under the hotlining process, a bill may advance quickly unless a Senator objects. The House unanimously passed the Hospital Inpatient Services Modernization Act, which would extend the program for five years, on December 1, 2025.
