## Full Article
WASHINGTON—JANUARY 2, 2026—The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), working jointly with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), today announced a fourth temporary extension of telemedicine flexibilities that allow patients to receive prescriptions for controlled medications without a prior in-person visit. The extension runs from January 1, 2026, through December 31, 2026, preventing disruptions in care while permanent rules are finalized.

This action ensures that patients who rely on telemedicine — including seniors, rural residents, people with disabilities, and individuals receiving treatment for mental health conditions or substance use disorder — can continue accessing care without interruption.

“Telehealth prescribing flexibilities have become a lifeline for millions of Americans,” said HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill. “Extending them ensures continuity of care while we finish the work of putting permanent, commonsense policies in place. This action protects patients, preserves access, and maintains strong controls against diversion.”

The telemedicine flexibilities were first introduced during the COVID-19 public health emergency and have remained in place through a series of temporary extensions. Without this action, patients and providers would face a sudden return to pre-pandemic restrictions — often referred to as the “telemedicine cliff” — which could abruptly cut off access to needed medications.

Data reviewed by federal agencies show that telemedicine plays a critical role in modern health care delivery. In 2024 alone, more than 7 million prescriptions for controlled medications were issued via telemedicine without a prior in-person visit. Past expirations of telemedicine policies have resulted in sharp declines in access, including a 24 percent drop in fee-for-service telemedicine visits following the lapse of Medicare telehealth flexibilities in September 2025.

The extension gives DEA and HHS additional time to finalize permanent regulations, including the proposed Special Registration for Telemedicine, which would establish clear standards for prescribing controlled substances via telemedicine while preserving patient safety and preventing misuse.

Importantly, the extension does not change existing requirements that prescriptions be issued for legitimate medical purposes, by licensed practitioners, and in compliance with federal and state law.

The fourth extension reflects the Administration’s commitment to patient-centered care, regulatory clarity, and public health, while avoiding unnecessary disruptions to treatment for millions of Americans.
