## Full Article
The Greater Houston Partnership returned to Washington, D.C. for its 2026 Fly-In with one clear objective: ensure Houston’s priorities remain front and center at the federal level.

Houston’s economy is deeply intertwined with national policy. The region is the #1 exporting metro in the United States, with nearly 330,000 jobs tied directly to international trade and the Port of Houston alone generates nearly one trillion dollars of annual economic impact. Federal decisions on energy, infrastructure, trade, immigration and small business policies directly influence the region’s continued growth and competitiveness.

Over three days, more than 100 Houston business and policy leaders met with:

Senator John Cornyn Senator Ted Cruz Senator John Curtis Congressman Brian Babin Congressman Troy Nehls Congressman Michael Cloud Congressman August Pfluger Congressman Dan Crenshaw Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher Congressman Morgan Luttrell The Offices of Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz Congressman Jodey Arrington Congressman Michael McCaul Congressman Randy Weber Congressman Chris Menefee Neil Harrington of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Deputy Secretary Andrew Hughes of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Deputy Administrator Bill Briggs of the U.S. Small Business Administration

Discussions focused on advancing the Partnership’s federal priorities, including strengthening Houston’s position as the Energy Capital of the World, securing funding and continued progress for the Coastal Texas Project, supporting infrastructure investment including the Houston Ship Channel, aligning immigration and workforce policy with employer needs and promoting international trade and small business competitiveness.

Houston is home to one of the largest concentrations of refining and petrochemical capacity in the world. Protecting that economic engine, while advancing innovation and energy transition, requires sustained federal engagement.

Rather than competing agendas, the delegation brought a unified regional voice focused on economic opportunity, resilience and long-term growth.

As the 119th Congress continues its work, the discussions that took place in Washington will help shape funding decisions, regulatory clarity and federal collaboration that directly impact Houston’s future.
