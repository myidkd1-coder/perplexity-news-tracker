KFF HEALTH NEWS ORIGINAL STORIES

KFF Health News: On The Hook For Uninsured Residents, Counties Now Wonder How They’ll Pay

In 2013, before the Affordable Care Act helped millions get health insurance, California’s Placer County provided limited health care to some 3,400 uninsured residents who couldn’t afford to see a doctor. For several years, that number has been zero in the predominantly white, largely rural county stretching from Sacramento’s eastern suburbs to the shores of Lake Tahoe.The trend could be short-lived.

KFF Health News: Older Americans Quit Weight-Loss Drugs In Droves

Year after year, Mary Bucklew strategized with a nurse practitioner about losing weight. “We tried exercise,” like walking 35 minutes a day, she recalled. “And 39,000 different diets.” But 5 pounds would come off and then invariably reappear, said Bucklew, 75, a public transit retiree in Ocean View, Delaware. Nothing seemed to make much difference — until 2023, when her body mass index slightly exceeded 40, the threshold for severe obesity. (Span, 1/6)

VACCINES

The Hill: Sen. Bill Cassidy Rips RFK Jr. Vaccine Schedule Change, Says It's 'Based On No Scientific Input'

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who cast a critical vote to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, on Monday blasted the reduction of the childhood immunization schedule by Kennedy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC announced Monday it would be reducing the number of recommended vaccines for children from 17 to 11, putting the U.S. in line with that of other developed countries like Denmark, a nation which anti-vaccine skeptics and critics often cite as a model to be emulated.

Stat: Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Blocking NIH Cap On Indirect Costs

Federal appeals court judges on Monday upheld a lower court’s ruling preventing the National Institutes of Health from cutting billions of dollars in support for research overhead at universities, academic medical centers, and other grantee institutions. (Wosen, 1/5)

Healthcare Dive: 340B Rebate Pilot Put On Hold In Temporary Win For Hospitals

A federal judge halted a controversial drug discount pilot over the holiday break, determining that the HHS didn’t adequately consider the consequences for safety-net hospitals in a setback for the Trump administration and for drugmakers. The pilot set to take effect on Jan. 1 would have allowed drugmakers to divvy out savings to providers in the 340B drug discount program through post-sale rebates instead of upfront discounts. (Pifer, 1/5)

AP: HHS Authorized To Resume Sharing Some Personal Medicaid Data With Deportation Officers

The nation’s health department starting Monday can resume sharing the personal data of certain Medicaid enrollees with deportation officials, according to a federal judge’s ruling, in a blow to states that had sued the administration over privacy concerns. But the judge’s decision, issued last Monday, strictly limits the scope of data from the 22 plaintiff states that can be shared — for now only allowing the agency to hand over basic biographical information about immigrants residing in the United States illegally. (Swenson, 1/5)

The Washington Post: Expanded Cervical Cancer Screenings To Be Covered By Most Private Insurance

The Department of Health and Human Services is endorsing self-collected vaginal samples for cervical cancer screening and requiring most private insurance plans to cover testing without cost sharing. The Health Resources and Services Administration, an agency within HHS, announced updated cervical cancer screening guidelines Monday that expand screening options to include self-collection to test for human papillomavirus, or HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that causes nearly all cervical cancer cases. The new guidelines also aim to lower out-of-pocket costs for screening that could deter people from getting care. (Chiu, 1/5)

MORE ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

AP: EPA Says It Will Propose Drinking Water Limit For Chemical In Explosives

The Environmental Protection Agency on Monday said it would propose a drinking water limit for perchlorate, a harmful chemical in rockets and other explosives, but also said doing so wouldn’t significantly benefit public health and that it was acting only because a court ordered it. The agency said it will seek input on how strict the limit should be for perchlorate, which is particularly dangerous for infants, and require utilities to test. (Phillis, 1/5)

The Hill: MAHA Movement Rejoices As Pesticide Rule Removed

A government funding bill released Monday excludes a controversial pesticides provision, marking a win for the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement for at least the time being. The provision in question is a wonky one: It would seek to prevent pesticides from carrying warnings on their label of health effects beyond those recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). (Frazin, 1/5)

The (Santa Clarita Valley) Signal: Wegovy Lots Recalled After Hair Detected In A Prefilled Syringe

OUTBREAKS AND HEALTH THREATS

CNN: Flu Reaches Highest Levels In The US In 25 Years

Flu continues to bring misery across the US, with all but four states showing high or very high levels of activity as a new virus strain called subclade K continues to spread. By another measure – visits to the doctor for fever plus a cough or sore throat, which are common flu symptoms – the US is at its highest level of respiratory illness since at least the 1997-98 flu season, according to data published Monday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Goodman, 1/5)

Stat: Flu Season 2026: Welcome To The Winter Of Subclade K

Australia’s 2025 flu season lasted weeks longer than it normally does. Hong Kong’s hit so early that the rollout of seasonal flu shots hadn’t yet started. New York has reported record-breaking flu hospitalizations for the past two weeks. Welcome to the winter of subclade K. (Branswell, 1/6)

CIDRAP: South Carolina Measles Total Climbs To 188

South Carolina health officials today said the state now has 188 cases of measles, 185 of which are associated with a growing outbreak in the Upstate region linked to elementary schools with low vaccination rates.

And yet here we are ..." (Dotinga, 1/5)

CIDRAP: In Utero COVID Exposure Linked To Brain Changes, Developmental Delays, Anxiety, And Depression

In utero SARS-CoV-2 exposure may predispose children to altered brain volumes, impaired cognition, and internalizing emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, researchers from Children’s National Hospital and George Washington University write in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. The team enrolled 39 mother-baby pairs in Washington, DC, who had been exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy from 2020 to 2022 and compared them with 103 normative pairs from before the pandemic (2016 to 2019). None of the infected women had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. (Van Beusekom, 1/5)

CIDRAP: Study Outlines Recurring Symptom Clusters That Define Long COVID

Long COVID is best understood as a collection of overlapping symptoms rather than a single post-viral condition, suggests a new systemic review published in eClinicalMedicine. The review identified the main symptom patterns associated with long COVID, including neurologic, respiratory, olfactory and/or gustatory, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue. (Bergeson, 1/5)

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

Undark: Medical Examiners Group Issues Warning On Stillbirth Test

The Nation's largest organization for medical examiners has issued a warning about a controversial, centuries-old forensic test that has contributed to cases in which pregnant women have been charged with murder. The premise behind the lung float test is simple: If a baby was born alive and then died, air from its first breaths would cause its lungs to float in a jar with water. If the baby was stillborn, the lack of air in the lungs would cause them to sink. But the many critics of the test have long labeled it junk science and drawn parallels between the test and witch trials, where women were deemed witches based on whether they floated or sank. (Eldeib, 1/6)

ProPublica: Her Parenting Time Was Restricted After A Positive Drug Test. By Federal Standards, It Would've Been Negative.

Kaitlin spent the first weeks of her newborn son’s life in a panic. The hospital where she gave birth in October 2022 had administered a routine drug test, and a nurse informed her the lab had confirmed the presence of opiates. Child welfare authorities opened an investigation. Months later, after searching her home and interviewing her older child and ex-husband, the agency dropped its investigation, having found no evidence of abuse or neglect, or of drug use. (Hines, 1/6)

St. Louis Public Radio: Planned Parenthood Closes Rolla Facility, Shifts To Telehealth

Planned Parenthood in Rolla has closed its brick-and-mortar location and will no longer serve patients in person.

(Robertson, 1/5)

NURSING HOMES AND ELDER CARE

AP: Victims Of Pennsylvania Nursing Home Blast File Negligence Lawsuit

Four people hurt when an explosion ripped through a Pennsylvania nursing home two weeks ago sued the facility and a natural gas utility on Monday, claiming their negligence was to blame. Two workers at Bristol Health & Rehab Center LLC, a resident of the suburban Philadelphia facility and a contractor who happened to be there when the blast occurred on Dec. 23 filed the lawsuit. ...

AP: Abuse, Neglect Common In Michigan Nursing Homes -- And No One Is Coming To Help

The plea was desperate: Help! Lorena Brown gasped for air on Sept. 12, 2022, turning blue, at the SKLD Muskegon nursing home. ... The former foster parent and cosmetologist is one of nearly three dozen residents to die of suspected neglect or abuse at Michigan nursing homes in the past four years, according to a Bridge Michigan review of more than 3,100 state and federal inspection records and court documents. ...

Private equity firms acquired more than 500 autism therapy centers across the U.S. in the past decade, an analysis showed. Between 2015 and 2024, 574 sites that delivered autism services in 42 states were bought by private equity, the result of 147 acquisitions, reported Daniel Arnold, PhD, of the School of Public Health at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and colleagues.

Newsweek: Simple Finger Prick Test Can Diagnose Alzheimer’s

Alzheimer’s disease affects millions worldwide—but confirming a diagnosis is far from simple. Doctors currently rely on costly brain scans or invasive spinal fluid tests to identify the condition—methods that can be stressful, time-consuming and out of reach for many patients. Now, researchers say a simpler approach could be on the horizon: just a quick prick of a patient’s fingertip might one day help doctors detect the disease, which affects an estimated 7.2 million Americans age 65 and older. (Notarantonio, 1/5)

The Washington Post: Stimulants Help Children With ADHD, But Not In The Way Scientists Thought

The stimulants Ritalin and Adderall have been used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for decades, but research shows they don’t act on the brain’s attention circuitry as had long been assumed. Instead, the medications primarily target the brain’s reward and wakefulness centers, according to a new study published in the journal Cell. The research, which used brain imaging data from almost 5,800 children ages 8 to 11, also pointed toward the important role that lack of sleep plays in the disorder. (Johnson, 1/6)

The Baltimore Sun: Researchers Re-Grow Cartilage In Mice With Arthritis

Sheffield was elected in November and was installed last week as Detroit’s first female mayor. The program gives a one-time allocation of $1,500 to expectant mothers during pregnancy. That’s followed by $500 per month throughout the child’s first six months after birth. (Williams, 1/5)
