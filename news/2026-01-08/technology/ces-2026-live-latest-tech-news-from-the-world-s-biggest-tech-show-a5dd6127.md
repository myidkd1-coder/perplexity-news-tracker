Our pick of the best of CES 2026 (Image credit: CTA) We've now spent many hours dashing around the vast halls of CES 2026 over the past few days – and our tech experts are finally ready to commit to their favorite tech from this year's show. You can read their conclusions in our pick of the 25 best gadgets we saw at CES 2026 – which covers everything from TVs to robovacs and headphones, via smart Lego bricks. I personally love the look of the Pebble Round 2, IKEA Varmblixt LED Lamp and Luna Band (if the price isn't too painful), but it's well worth reading the whole roundup to get a flavor of some of the most exciting tech of 2026. Read the full story: The 25 best gadgets we saw at CES 2026 — smart Lego, big TV innovation, a robovac with legs, and much more

'The best mopping system I've seen' (Image credit: Future) Robot vacuums are now a CES staple, and Homes Editor Ruth Hamilton has seen many of the latest models on show. One standout is the new Roborock Saros 20 Sonic, which she says "made me do a double-take when I saw it in action". That's because of its rather clever mopping system. It has a flat, D-shaped pad (rather than the traditional twin spinning discs), which means it promises to get into places other robovacs can't. Like many things at CES, there's no pricing yet, but the Saros 20 Sonic will get a global rollout this year – and as someone who's looking for a robot vacuum with powerful mopping powers, I'll be keeping a close eye on it. Read the full story: Roborock just introduced an innovative new robot vac mopping system — and it looks seriously good

Need a bigger laptop screen? Lenovo is ready to roll One of the coolest things we're seeing at CES 2026 is the new rollable display technology from Lenovo. We've seen prototypes from Lenovo and its wholly-owned Motorola division of phones and laptops that can roll-up a display to become more compact, or roll out the display to offer more screen area. This year, we're seeing laptops with huge displays that grow vertically or horizontally - depending on whether you want to be productive (vertical) or play a bunch of games (horizontal). Check out our hands-on look at the latest Lenovo Legion Pro rollable laptop for road warriors who work with very big spreadsheets. And click through for the rest of the YouTube videos our TechRadar team has put together at the big Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas.

I wanna feed the birdies without breaking my budget (Image credit: Birdbuddy) If you're like me, you've seen bird feeder videos and thought about buying a feeder + camera to hang near your home. Then the sticker shock hits. In flies Birdbuddy with its new, smaller and more affordable Birdbuddy 2. This is a feeder plus camera in one, and it's the cheapest version yet from one of the established names in electronic birding. You can check out our impressions of Birdbuddy 2 from CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff is on the scene surveying all the newest gadgets.

(Image credit: Future) The 11 best gadgets we've seen today, all in one convenient package We're closing the lid on Day 3 of CES 2026 here in Las Vegas. We'll keep rounding up all the news here - there's so much to show you! But if you want the highlights, check out our CES 2026 Day 3 round-up with the 11 best things we saw on the show floor on our third day at the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond. We got to check out a robocar from Tensor! Of course we spent time with the new Motorola Razr Fold handset, as well as all the new electronics gear from Ikea. There were speakers and headphones, gear for health and wellness, and new controllers for gamers. Pretty much everything exciting about Consumer Electronics, all in one story. We're still wandering the halls and peeking into booths, so check back often for the latest CES 2026 news and highlights.

CES is so old that it goes out of style and comes back again (Image credit: IKEA) Technology enthusiasts know CES has been around for a long time, so long that technology we used to love seeing in Las Vegas has gone out of style and come back again - like record turntables and Hi-Fi gear. We saw cool turntables and a ton of Bluetooth speakers, including a special new kit from Ikea that will let you pair up to 100 small speaker boxes in unison. Our Audio Editor Becky Scarrott has the full rundown in her take on the best hi-fi equipment we saw at CES 2026. Come for the sleek new Audio Technica turntable, but stay for the colorful new Ikea Kallsup speakers.

This, but it's half as tall and it runs Android instead of iOS (Image credit: Philip Berne / Future) As the US Mobiles Editor, I have a bit of a phone bias, but this Clicks Communicator might be the coolest thing I've seen coming out of Las Vegas during CES 2026. This is the company - with Future alumnus Michael Fisher, aka Mr. Mobile, and CrackBerry Kevin at the helm - that created a keyboard that snaps onto your iPhones, then onto your Motorola Razr. Now the company is back with a proper BlackBerr..., err, Android phone with a keyboard. I'll be excited to get this in my hands and in Future Labs for a full review. In the meantime, check out our hands-on video from the show floor of the Clicks Communicator, and all our great TikTok video content. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Motorola takes on Samsung's most expensive phone with the new Razr Fold (Image credit: Motorola) Maybe it's because I'm a Phones Guy, but the Motorola Razr Fold might be the most exciting new product I've seen at CES 2026 so far. We don't know much about this Galaxy Z Fold 7 (and Pixel 10 Pro Fold) competitor, but Motorola's Razr phones beat Samsung's Z Flip clamshells when it comes to design and color options. I'm hoping the Razr Fold offers the same advantages. It looks more like Motorola will be competing on price, which is a good move considering the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the most expensive phone you can buy in most regions right now (until that Galaxy Z Trifold appears). I'll be looking out for this cool new foldable phone until we learn more. The Motorola Razr Fold, open (Image credit: Motorola)

Bane never looked so beautiful (Image credit: Future) LED face masks are all the rage, and at CES L'Oréal showcased an ultra-thin, flexible silicone one that should be a lot more comfortable to wear. We had the hance to check it out, alongside the brand's innovative infrared Light Straight + hair straightener, and were impressed with how bendable and lightweight it was. Unfortunatley due to hygeine reasons we couldn't actually wear the mask (who would want to share a mask you thousands of other people), but we could hold it and it really is a far cry from the rigid masks we've seen previously. Unfortunately we'll have to wait a while before we can test it properly too, as it isn't scheduled for launch until 2027.

Somehow the RTX 4090 returned? (Image credit: Nvidia) Is Nvidia about to rerelease its older GPUs (like the RTX 4090) to help relieve pressure on the gaming market as component costs rise? "Possibly" according to CEO Jenson Huang. That's according to an answer he gave during a live Q&A at CES 2026, though if you read his full statement and listen to his tone it feels like this might be a remote possibility at besty. Instead, in a latter part of his answer to the Tom's Hardware question , Huang suggested an alternate route could see Nvidia engineer its "latest-generation AI technology" to work with older ranges of GeForce graphics cards. Potentially bringing RTX 5000 series exclusives like DLSS 4 to older compatible models. This move could help Nvidia regain some of its lost popularity with gamers who feel like they've been sidelined while the company puts all of its GPU eggs in the AI basket. It would unfortunantely "require a fair amount of engineering" to get these tools working on older cards Huang admits, but in the sea of negativity that is PC compoennt prices at least Nvidia is making some positive noises. Let's hope it takes some positive actions soon too. Read the full story: Jensen Huang hints that Nvidia could consider bringing back older graphics cards to solve GPU pricing crisis

The world's first 'personal robocar' Robotaxis are on the rise, but what if you want to buy your own fully autonomous car? Tensor claims to be the only level 4 autonomous car you can buy (well, when it goes into production later this year), and it's packed with some pretty sci-fi features. The first is that it doesn't have a steering wheel, or at least one that's immediately obvious. Skip to 4:20 in our video tour below to see how the wheel slowly appears from behind a screen (which is the default in its hands-off, eyes-off driving mode). Inside the car, everyone gets 13-inch screens and there's also a powerful computer with an agentic AI assistant. Tensor is promising that the car has about 300 miles of range, but has been suspiciously quiet on pricing (aside from saying it'll be "in the luxury segment"). Ah well, my dream of a real KITT car was never going to come cheap... @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Headphones now have eyes (Image credit: Razer) I'm not sure how to feel about this one – Razer has just revealed a new concept gaming headset that combines cameras, microphones and AI to help it act like a background assistant. The Project Motoko headset has dual, forward-facing cameras that share information with AI models to help it recognize whatever you're looking at. Apparently, this means it can respond to visual cues, translate signs, track workouts and even summarize documents. Clearly, the AI wearables battle is heating up in 2026, and few tech companies can resist getting involved. But does this mean literally everything has to have cameras? The only solution for privacy might soon be walking around wearing one of those weird LED face masks... Read the full story: Wearable AI is coming — and Razer’s Project Motoko is leading the charge with smart headphones

(Image credit: Nuralogix) One of the main themes emerging at the conference this year is health tech, specifically longevity. The big gadget getting tongues wagging (and top of our list of 5 health gadgets you need to know about at CES 2026) is the NuraLogix Longevity Mirror. Using AI-powered cameras, the mirror analyses the blood flow in your face to tell you about your blood pressure, aging and a host of other metrics. Truly wild stuff, even if we didn't think the humble mirror could get any more honest with us.

Lenovo's making Friends @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Another gem from our TikTok channel, we were on the ground as Lenovo unveiled its new AI pendant concept housing Qira, its personal AI agent. Qira can take notes in meetings and record conversations, playing them back on request when spoken to in natural language. It's a little similar to that eerie AI Friend concept that did the rounds last year, although this pendant seems more functional, aimed at businesspeople rather than those after a companion. It joins the Plaud AI Pin, Switchbot AI Mindclip and previously-announced Pebble Index 01 as the latest "second brain" AI wearable on the show floor.

Victrola’s new soundbase is perfect for vinyl beginners (Image credit: Victrola) There's never been a better time to be getting into vinyl, especially with all the new gear available these days. If you're not quite ready to splurge on a full hi-fi system, then Victrola has the perfect solution: the Victrola Soundstage. This soundbase doubles as an all-in-one speaker system and a stand to prop up your turntable. It’s set to go on sale sometime from June for $349.99, which is around £260 in the UK and AU$500 in Australia – although we don't yet know if it will launch in these markets. Read more: This new turntable speaker is a perfect space-saving buy for new vinyl owners

A new subscription-free fitness wearable? Finally! (Image credit: Luna) It’s rare to find a tech product that doesn’t require a subscription these days, which is why the new Luna Band stands out. This screenless, voice-activated fitness wearable promises to deliver health updates on your diet, workouts, sleep, mood and more. The only catch? We don’t yet know the price or release date... Read more: Looking for a subscription-free Whoop band? This screenless rival could be the voice-led wearable you’re looking for

Lenovo rolls out the red carpet for gamers @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Have you been keeping up with our latest CES 2026 videos on TikTok? If not, head over to our channel to see what’s caught our eye, including a first glimpse of the rumored Legion Pro Rollable gaming laptop out in the wild. This 16-inch laptop features Lenovo’s first horizontally rolling display for gamers, expanding to a generous 23.8 inches of screen space.

This new gadget identifies birds by their song (Image credit: Birdbuddy) Hear that? Well, maybe you can't, but Birdbuddy's newest bird feeder camera being launched in Las Vegas can. The all-new Birdbuddy 2 Mini is smaller and more affordable, but it also brings a major upgrade to its smart AI detection. Along with identifying birds from recordings and photos, it can now recognize them by their birdsong too.

Our day 2 highlights are here (Image credit: Clicks / Lego / Luna) To get you up to speed quickly, let's start with an easy one: here's our roundup of the 11 best gadgets we saw at CES day 2. I won't list them all here, but as you can see in the picture above, one of them is a BlackBerry. Well, okay, not an actual BlackBerry – but arguably the closest thing you can get today, in the form of the Clicks Communicator – a new phone, in 2026, with a keyboard. Yes, really. It'll be shipping later this year if that sounds exciting to you.

Good morning, everyone. Las Vegas is still asleep – or at least some people in Vegas are asleep, I suspect others will be in casinos and bars. But the show is dormant for a while, so let's recap some of the highlights from day 2 of the show.

(Image credit: Nvidia) If you're a deep diver in the world of gaming technology, you'll be interested to know that NVIDIA has announced the latest version of its incredible upscaling technology at CES 2026. The next DLSS 4.5 update will be available for free if you own a GTX 5000-series card, and it could silence complaints from gamers who claimed NVIDIA was skipping frames to maximize performance. Our Computing Editor Christian Guyton learned all about DLSS 4.5 in Las Vegas and he can tell you more.

A smaller-than-130-inch Samsung S90H TV at CES 2026 (Image credit: Future) CES 2026 is a big show, and that means it's a great time for big TVs! Samsung is breaking out one of its biggest television sets ever in this 130-inch RGB TV. Our Entertainment Editor Matt Bolton can barely see the top of this humongous thing! You can check out Samsung's big 130-inch panel on TechRadar's TikTok, along with all the other cool gadgets we've seen in Las Vegas.

The phone you'd make if your Threads handle was Captain2Phones (Image credit: Clicks) We get up mighty early here at TechRadar, so we've already compiled our CES 2026 Day 2 round-up, featuring 11 of the best gadgets we saw on our second day at the big show in Las Vegas. We've got cool new toys like the Lego Smart Brick, some retro turntables with amazing sound quality for vinyl enthusiasts, and... Wait... is that a BlackBerry phone?! Nope, but it's pretty close. Check out the Clicks Communicator, a real Android device that looks like a retro BlackBerry, launching at CES from our friends at Clicks. We're still going because the TechRadar CES party never stops!

The first Dolby Vision 2 sets from one of the biggest names in affordable home theater (Image credit: Future) Are you a fan of home theater? If so, you've probably been waiting anxiously for Dolby Vision 2 equipment to finally hit the market. We've got our eyes on Dolby's newest standard for TV's and video equipment, and here at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, we can even see Dolby Vision 2 in action on Hisense TVs. Hisense was long-rumored to be one of the first approved TV-makers to support Vision 2, but of course the sets had to actually go through the testing and approval process. We're hearing that some of the TVs that are with us live in Vegas have finally met with Dolby approval. Will we be able to buy them and install them before the next big game? We'll know soon.

There's always some new health testing kits at CES (Image credit: Eli Health) It's not all fun and games and walking robots at CES 2026, there are plenty of consumer health gadgets on display as well. The home testing market especially is always good for new innovations in Vegas. A few years back, we saw the first home urine analysis gear from Withings at CES. This year we're seeing the first home hormone testing kit. Health company Eli is launching its hormometer for all of your home hormone testing needs. It reads your saliva (and you need to produce quite the quantity) for testing, and you can read all about it - including hormone test results from our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff.

A vacuum robot that can walk? That's an idea with... potential Do you have stairs in your house and a healthy envy of vacuum robots? Do you wish that your vacuum could just kick stuff out of the way? Enter the Roborock Saros Rover vacuum, a robot vacuum with <checks notes> legs?! Seriously?! A robot vacuum with legs? Okay, this is one you just have to see to believe. In any case, weird CES is back in 2026, and we're live on the scene checking out all the coolest gadgets in Las Vegas. Check out the walking vacuum robot below, or at TikTok. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Confirmed: the first TV brands supporting Dolby Vision 2 (Image credit: Future) Some hot-off-the-press AV news for you – we've just heard which TV brands are going to support Dolby Vision 2, the next version of the popular HDR format. Announced at CES 2026, the big three (for now) are Hisense, TCL and Philips, which will all support Dolby Vision 2 in some of their upcoming sets this year. You can find out exactly which models in our story about Dolby's news. So what about the other big TV brands? Well, some are likely to announce support for the format later this year alongside their new sets – we can expect Sony to among those. Samsung, meanwhile, has never supported Dolby Vision. But the surprise missing name is LG, which has so far proved non-committal on the subject. Still, its new OLED TVs look pretty fantastic regardless...

HP just shoehorned a PC into a keyboard (Image credit: HP) Staying on the subject of convergence, HP has pulled out its shrink ray at CES 2026 and squeezed a Copilot+ PC into this pretty slimline keyboard. The EliteBoard G1a (product names have never been HP's thing) is only 12mm thick and weighs 750 grams, but manages to pack in an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series chip, built-in speakers and dual mics. Another tick is the user-replaceable 35Wh battery, and you can add a fingerprint sensor for biometric logins, too. Of course, this isn't the first PC-in-a-keyboard we've seen (if you're old like me, you'll remember Commodore Amigas in the 1980s), but it is an elegant bit of computing design. Unfortunately, we don't yet know how much that design will set you back when it lands in March 2026... (Image credit: HP)

The ultimate flashlight? Mark Wilson (TechRadar's news editor) taking over for the liveblog for a while here – and I've just spotted a gadget on our TikTok channel that's pure CES. The Timeli smart personal safety system (watch our hands-on below) is a cross between a flashlight and a personal GPS safety system. Alongside being blindingly bright, it has live GPS tracking, a loud alarm, and two-way voice communication with emergency dispatch. A satisfying red button also helps to trigger the latter. Is the Timeli completely unnecessary overkill, or a new essential for your off-grid adventures? I'll let you decide, but one thing that could sway you is the price – it'll be $299 when it lands in February, which gives you a year of free service, after which you'll pay $9.95 a month. There's no escaping those subscriptions in 2026, after all... @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Is AI getting a bit too serious for your liking? Do you wish you could just escape all of the AI news and developments? Do you need a drink? Good news! Here's a new AI bartender, ready to serve... booze. Our team in Las Vegas got a chance to check out this new AI robot that can make your favorite libations (or whatever it decides your favorite should be), and we walked away thirsty for more. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

When is a processor exciting? When it's a Snapdragon (Image credit: Qualcomm) Qualcomm shook up the laptop world with its first Snapdragon X chips, offering incredible battery life and top-notch performance at a lower price than Intel's iron. We've already seen the sequel in the Snapdragon X2 Elite high-performance chip, and at CES 2026 the chipmaker is showing off a more affordable version of its next-gen laptop chipset: the Snapdragon X2 Plus. The new X2 Plus chip offers fewer processor cores than the Snapdragon X2 Elite chip we already knew about, so this should be an even more affordable processor to pack ultrathin laptops and hybrid tablets running Windows. Our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff got hands-on with Qualcomm's reference design laptops housing the latest processor inside: @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

@techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar Back to laptops now, and our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has gone hands on with the new Snapdragon X2 Plus, Qualcomm's new 3-nanometer AI chipset designed to bring ultra-powerful performance to everyone from business owners to gamers. Check out the video for more juicy details.

Talk to the band (Image credit: Luna) The latest fitness tracker debuting at CES presents a new alternative to clumsy interfaces on tiny screens. The Luna Band is a fitness tracker without a screen, like Whoop (without a subscription) or the new Polar Loop, and it's designed to be operated via voice. It specializes in “real-time, voice-led health guidance”, the idea being that you can log your meals, mood and emotions by speaking to the device, and view it all in the app at a later date. This is apparently done via Siri, but there's no word on Android compatibility. It sounds elegant: here's hoping it works in practice.

The Blackberry strikes back (Image credit: Clicks) Well, kind of. It's not strictly a Blackberry, but the Clicks Communicator shows, along with the Pebble Round 2, that people are getting fed up of their black mirrors and yearn to return to the days when gadgetry was all about fun, not data collection. With Android 16, the Google Play Store on tap, along with modern innovations like wireless charging and 256GB of internal storage, the Clicks Communicator is a Blackberry-style PDA with a physical keyboard fit for 2026. A single rear camera lens and a 3.5mm headphone jack shows it means business about being a stripped-back, retro comms device. Best of all, it's very affordable, with pre-orders from $399 (around £295 / AU$595).

(Image credit: Boston Dynamics) After many years of showcasing their humanoid robots get kicked, pushed and otherwise roughed up in many viral stress-test videos, Boston Dynamics is ready to enter the workforce with its Atlas humanoid in 2028. Designed for a factory environment, it boasts freedom of movement to help it find more efficient movement pathways than a human is capable of (we were mesmerized watching its joints swivel, both creepy and cool) along with self-battery replacement, the ability to lift up to 110 pounds, and even weatherproofing. It's starting its journey at the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Savannah, Georgia, and will probably be assembling cars by 2030. Read all about it here.

(Image credit: Future) "I got blue lips and weak knees on my first day at CES 2026" is a heck of a headline, so definitely check out our Editor-at-Large, Lance Ulanoff's recap of his first day at this year's CES, including a cutting-edge knife (pun intended), and a $20,000 robotic massage chair that "aggressively massaged my back and butt."

(Image credit: Samsung) Hi all, it's Matt Hanson taking over this live blog for a while! I've just written up a report on Samsung's latest laptops, which it launched at CES. I've been really impressed with Samsung's laptops recently, so I'm really keen to try out these new models, especially as they are powered by Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 3 processors, which are shaping up to be a real return to form.

We've tried Shokz' new open earbuds (Image credit: Future) Open earbuds have experienced massive growth over the past few years, and are now the listening device of choice for many runners, cyclists and sporty types in general. Shokz makes some of the best – so we were eager to go ears-on with its new OpenFit Pro. And the good news is that we very much like what we've heard so far. The big story here is that these are the first Shokz earbuds to feature a "synchronized dual-diaphragm driver and noise reduction" – which, for the layperson, means they offer a form of noise cancellation despite their open-ear design. Get the full details below… FULL STORY: I’ve worn the all-new Shokz open earbuds for 4 days and the ‘noise reduction’ is so good, I forget they’re open-ear

The new king of turntables? (Image credit: Audio-Technica) Nothing beats the warm sound of vinyl, whatever your music tastes – so the fact that Audio-Technica has launched a new turntable at CES 2026 is good news. The Audio-Technica AT-LP7X is the replacement for the esteemed AT-LP7, which has been around for years now and so probably was due an update. It's a fully manual belt-driven model that focuses more on audio fidelity than fancy gimmicks, and it will set you back £679 / €799 (about $920 / AU$1,369). FULL STORY: Audio-Technica just updated one of its best ever turntables at CES 2026, and I want it

Good morning and welcome to day 1 day 2 day 3 of CES 2026. Actually, I'm not really sure what day it is. Technically CES opens today, but the media day was yesterday and our coverage started fully on Sunday. Anyway, the key thing is that CES IS FULLY UNDERWAY and there are loads of massive stories coming out from it.

The Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold, from our hands-on live at CES 2026 (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) We're covering all the CES 2026 news here, but if you want to focus on just NVIDIA and its gaming and graphics card news (among its many endeavors), we'll be going live once Jensen Huang takes the stage for the NVIDIA CES Keynote at 9pm PT in Las Vegas. You can follow along at that attached link.

Watch LG TVs do magic tricks in Las Vegas You can't spell CES without TVs, and the biggest name in TVs - LG - has some big new sets on display in Las Vegas. We got to spend some time with these high-quality displays, including one of the thinnest TV's we've ever seen - a 'Wallpaper' OLED that you have to see to believe.

We round up the best gadgets of CES 2026 that we saw on day one! (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) It's only Day 1 of CES 2026, so how much could we have possibly seen? Enough to make a list of the 11 best gadgets we saw at CES already, with some seriously cool new, retro, and upcoming technology. Have you been curious about the revenant Pebble Watch? We got hands-on in Las Vegas. Want to see the famous Samsung Galaxy Trifold live and in the flex? We flexed it for you. How about an ultrasonic knife?! I'm not joking, it's in there.

Withings reveals its 'longevity station' (Image credit: Withings) I have to applaud Withings for dreaming up a more exciting name for smart scales at CES 2026. It's billing its new Body Scan 2 as a "longevity station", because it can apparently measure your current (and future) health with greater accuracy than before. That's because its smart scale – which includes a retractable handle – can now track over 60 biomarkers, including your body composition, artery health, hypertension risk and more. Actually, after spending two weeks eating chocolate and cheese, I'm not sure I want its 90-second "longevity assessment", but it certainly sounds like a new contender for our guide to the best smart scales (if you can stomach the $599 price tag, which converts to around £445 / AU$895).

Hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold (Image credit: Lance Ulanoff / Future) Samsung's first tri-folding phone just made its US debut at CES 2026 – and TechRadar's Editor At Large has just spent some quality time with it. Our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold review has all the details, but the takeaway is that it's a "remarkable feat of engineering" that gives you "truly pocketable big-screen tablet productivity". Its 10-inch screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio also makes a lot of sense for watching movies on the move. The only question now is how much it'll cost – in Korea, it starts at 3.59 million KRW (about $2,500) but we still don't know its official global pricing.

Behold, the robots of CES 2026 (Image credit: SwitchBot) Hello, Mark Wilson (TechRadar's UK news editor) here and I'm taking over this liveblog for the next hour. For me, CES is mainly about robots. And you know, sensible things like Qi2 phone chargers. But mainly robots. And fortunately, we've already seen a couple of promising new ones make their debuts in Las Vegas. Hot on the heels of the laundry-folding heels of the SwitchBot Onero H1 (above) is the LG CLOiD humanoid robot. Yes, it takes 45 seconds to put a wet towel into a washing machine, but one day (maybe CES 2046) that'll be down to five seconds and we'll be living in laundry dreamland. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Another exciting AI-powered gadget from the show floor is Nosh, a robot chef that uses AI to select ingredients, prep and make a meal. With 500 recipes onboard spanning various cultures, cuisines and even beverages, there's a lot to love about this home assistant, especially for those with accessibility needs. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Let's briefly head back to Lance on the show floor, where he's been trying out Fraimic, a new e-ink photo frame that creates bespoke artwork for your walls. With the power of voice prompts, WhisperAI and ChatGPT, this makes for a fun addition to your home. Just be careful you don't accidentally prompt the creation of some Eldrich horror while you're chatting about Hallowe'en plans at home. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Soundcore) "Only 5 days in, the best fitness headphones of 2026 have already been announced" – bold claims from one of our regular contributors, Tom Bedford, as he's got his sights set on Anker's new kind-of-sort-of open earbuds. So what's the source of the ambiguity? Well, the Aerofit 2 Pro are hybrid headphones with different modes that adjust the depth of the earbud itself extends into your ear, meaning you can benefit from both ANC and open ear audio.

What's that? Why, it's an itty-bitty teeny-weeny mini action camerini! DJI has some competition from newcomer Leaptic, a brand releasing a new kind of tiny action cam at CES. It's strikingly similar in design to the Osmo Nano, but otherwise we don't know much, only that it will shoot video at a higher 8K resolution and weighs just 35g. Stay tuned for more news this week!

Hot off the press! We've shared our first impression of Samsung's new Galaxy Z Trifold phone, and it's a doozy. Naturally, we're impressed by its thinness and screen real estate, but time will tell how performance, battery and user experience will factor in to this incredible feat of design. We've thus far only spent a few minutes with the device, so hold your horses if you're expecting a full review; that'll come in time.

(Image credit: Amazon) Josie here now to fill you in on the latest CES news. Oh, looks like Samsung’s The Frame and LG W6 'Wallpaper' have some competition in the discrete screen category, with Amazon announcing the Amazon Ember Artline, a 4K QLED TV with support for HDR10+ and Dolby Vision finished with a matte coating to block reflections on the screen and ultimately reduce glare. At just 1.5 inches, it's impressively thin, and comes with over 2,000 pre-loaded artworks to spruce up your home — or you can connect it to your Amazon Photos to choose from your favorite shots. Better yet, if you're spoiled for choice, Amazon's AI has the power to help you; simply share four pictures of where the Ember Artline is hung and it'll analyze the space to recommend photos or artworks that match your decor. It also features Amazon’s Omnisense Technology for intelligent screen activation when you enter (or leave) a room.

(Image credit: Future) Straight from the halls of CES 2026 comes this report from our TV expert Al Griffin, who has seen TCL's next-generation SQD mini-LED TV, which the firm is hyping up as the 'best TV in the market.' As Al explains, SQD stands for Super Quantum Dots, and the tech alongside TCL's Deep Color System should make for some very impressive images, and will look particularly good in large TVs. That's good to hear, as the TCL X11L SQD mini-LED TV will go on sale later this month in 98 and 85-inch screens, with a 75-incher coming later.

(Image credit: Future) At CES 2026 we're trying something new: a live Q&A that allows you to ask our team of experts who are on the ground in Las Vegas about what new and exciting gadgets they're seeing. All you need to do is sign in or sign up (it's free!) to our commenting system, then post your questions and one of the team will answer it. Seen a cool-looking TV you want to know more about? Fancy the look of a laptop but want to know more about the specs? Then this is your chance to ask us directly. We'll try to get back to every question as soon as possible, though due to time zone differences and inevitable Wi-Fi wonkiness, there might be a bit of a delay, but hopefully we'll keep that to a minimum.

(Image credit: Govee) CES is a great show for smart home products, and Govee has just announced some great new smart lights, and we have all the information you need. I particularly like the look of the Ceiling Light Ultra, which comes with a 616-pixel LED matrix that can show animated scenes, though I'm slightly concerned that the price will be very expensive. Hopefully we'll get pricing information soon as well. (Image credit: Govee)

It's Matt again (you'll probably see a few of us take turns on this blog), and my colleague John Loeffler is at CES 2026 helping to cover all the computing news that will come out of the huge tech show. As with previous years, we'll be hearing from some of the biggest brands in computing, including Asus, Acer, Nvidia and Intel. (Image credit: Getty Images / Moor Studio) Before that, however, what is John looking forward to seeing at this year's show? Well, you can read his early hopes, which include wanting to see AI (artificial intelligence) features that are actually impressive. Like John, I've so far not been too impressed with AI, despite many companies promising that it will revolutionise our gadgets - and our lives. Hopefully, CES 2026 changes that, as there's no doubt there'll be plenty of talk about AI at Las Vegas this year.

It's not all big-ticket tech at CES – our Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff has had his hands on a new digital fidget toy with clickable buttons and a collection of pre-installed games. You also get the fun of building it, because it comes as a little kit to keep your hands busy. Check it out! @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Samsung Display) Hi there! Homes editor Cat Ellis here, taking over the live blog for a moment to bring you some interesting musings on the latest developments in TV tech. We've seen some very exciting new screens at CES, but our writer Carrie Marshall thinks the latest panels might not be all they seem. New TVs from LG and Samsung promise up to 4,500 nits at peak brightness, but Carrie points out that those results would have been achieved in very specific controlled conditions, so you're not likely to need shades to watch The Night Manager any time soon.

Lance, our Editor-at-Large, is at CES in Las Vegas, and he's been posting some great videos of all the cool gadgets he's seen so far on our TikTok channel. This has led to a nice jump-scare this morning for me as I scrolled our live blog and saw a video of Lance waving a knife around. For a slightly less concerning video, here's Lance testing out what at first looks like one of Tony Stark's prototypes, but is actually a massage chair. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

(Image credit: Apple) Morning everyone, it's Matt Hanson, Managing Editor of Core Tech, and I'll be covering CES announcements here for an hour or so. Like my boss, Marc, I am not in warm Las Vegas, but in chilly and slightly snowy Bath, UK, and the image above is an accurate depiction of how I am dressed today. Fraggle-chic, I call it.

Meet the LG C6H… (Image credit: Future) Many of the big announcements so far have been around TVs, with Samsung and LG's efforts in particular standing out. Let's start with LG – because it's making a big change for its almost-flagship 'C' series OLED for 2026, with the C6 coming in not one but two versions. Yes, that's right: you'll be able to buy either the standard C6, or the new C6H model, with the latter using a fancy Primary RGB Tandem panel, as seen in last year's flagship G5 set. This should make for better brightness and color – with the downside being that it'll only be available in 77- and 83-inch sizes. You can get more detail on the new LG C6 and C6H here, and stay tuned for further updates as we get them.

Good morning from the UK. Marc McLaren here, taking over for a post or two – but from cold, snowy London, not warm, sunny Las Vegas.

Beyond the massive TVs – looking at you, Samsung's 130-inch Micro RGB TV – we spotted a unique take on a classic kitchen gadget at CES Unveiled. What looks like a standard knife for cutting vegetables actually uses microvibrations to make slicing and dicing much easier. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

We saw the Pebble Round 2 (Image credit: Core Devices) Thanks to a suprise announcement last week, we knew we'd get the chance to see the Pebble Round 2 at CES, and our first look at the new smartwatch has arrived on TechRadar's TikTok. Now back to life thanks to Core Devices, the Pebble Round 2 is boasting an edge-to-edge, round color e-paper display and promises one week of battery life. That's a big difference compared to the other leading smartwatches, and the Round 2 arrives a decade after the previous Round watch hit the market. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Here's one peek behind the scenes, and I bet you'll see it trending on TikTok from folks visiting Samsung's space at The Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas for CES 2026. They set up a sort of tunnel within a ballroom filled with speakers and numerous projectors to change the environment and, at times, immerse you in color. It's really neat and got folks talking before they even saw all the new TVs and other gadgets. I especially like the mirror entrances at the front and back, which give the illusion that this goes on for miles.

Samsung stuns with new TVS – OLED, Frame, and Micro RGB included Samsung's First Look might be wrapped, but TechRadar is the place to be, thanks to our team of experts breaking down all that was unveiled. And the star of the show is a new concept, but one that we viewed with our own eyes – Samsung's new 130-inch Micro RGB TV. It not only stretches farther than the 115-inch model Samsung's been selling since last year, but it can also be wall-mounted or sat on a pretty incredible stand. (Image credit: Future) Similarly, the major-sized 98-inch standard Frame TV ... might well just be the TV of my dreams. Though I'm a bit scared for the eventual price reveal. Meanwhile, Samsung also made some updates to its lineup of OLED TVs. Yes, even with the arrival of Micro RGB TVs in various sizes, Samsung's still offering QLED, Neo QLED, and OLED. Notably, the flagship OLED is brighter, includes a metal stand, and will display works of art via Art Mode. Samsung reveals upgraded OLED TVs and super-sized screens at CES 2026

We'll have more from CES Unveiled shortly, but Samsung's big First Look 2025 event is about to kick off. Given that the tech giant isn't doing a formal keynote this year, this will be Samsung's big presentation. Historically, this has been the place for Samsung to unveil new TVs, home audio, and monitors, but in more recent years, it's all also been about AI, AI, and more AI. Samsung's already teased and even pre-announced some key things – including an expansion of its microRGB lineup – so it'll likely be a full presentation.

First, let's start with one of the first products that stood out to Lance Ulanoff at CES Unveiled. You can see his first look TikTok below, but SkyWheel Peak S is basically a wearable that will let you feel like you're skiing on almost any surface. Pretty neat, I'd say. @techradar ♬ original sound - TechRadar

Hello and welcome to TechRadar's CES 2026 live blog. I'm your host, Jacob Krol, and I'm out in Vegas right now.
