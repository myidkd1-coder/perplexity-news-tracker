Stock markets rebounded on Monday (February 2) with benchmark Sensex jumping by 943 points on value buying in blue-chip oil & gas, banking and auto shares after facing a massive drubbing on the Budget day.

The 30-share BSE Sensex rallied 943.52 points or 1.17 per cent, to settle at 81,666.46. During the day, it surged 1,009.31 points or 1.25 per cent to a high of 81,732.25.

The 50-share NSE Nifty climbed 262.95 points or 1.06 per cent to end at 25,088.40. During the day, it advanced 282.65 points or 1.13 per cent to 25,108.10.

A sharp decline in global crude oil prices offered relief to the markets, experts said.

"The market witnessed a smart recovery following yesterday’s volatile session due to the impact of the STT hike on F&O and the government’s higher borrowing plan for FY27. At the same time, the Budget’s policy continuity with a clear emphasis on growth and fiscal prudence has helped reinforce confidence in the medium‑ to long‑term earnings outlook.

"A sharp decline in global crude oil prices has also offered some relief, reflecting signs of easing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran," Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.
