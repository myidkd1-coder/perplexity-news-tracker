Consumption Set for 2026 Resurgence

India's economic narrative in 2026 is increasingly centered on a strengthening consumption-led growth cycle. Economists project that a combination of moderate inflation, robust policy support, and improving demand conditions will solidify the recovery that gained traction in the latter half of 2025. Direct tax relief, Goods and Services Tax (GST) reductions, and cumulative monetary policy rate cuts have already begun boosting disposable incomes and improving borrowing conditions, creating a favorable macro environment for a widespread consumption upturn.

Policy Tailwinds Bolster Incomes

Analysts anticipate that the confluence of benign inflation trends, enhanced household purchasing power, and supportive fiscal-monetary measures will sustain economic momentum into 2026. This alignment is expected to provide crucial resilience to India's growth amidst global uncertainties. Sakshi Gupta, VP & Principal Economist at HDFC Bank, noted that inflation is likely to remain moderate, bolstered by favorable supply chains and policy interventions. "Consumption recovery is expected to broaden further over FY27, with monetary and fiscal measures in FY26 helping lift demand," Gupta stated, expecting urban demand to gain sustainable momentum.

Inflationary Environment Supports Demand

The disinflationary environment of 2025 significantly improved real household purchasing power and created critical policy space. Government data revealed that retail inflation stayed consistently below expectations, facilitating growth-supportive measures. The government's response included easing income tax rates and GST, collectively leaving approximately ₹1.5 trillion in disposable savings. Complementing these efforts, the Reserve Bank of India cut policy rates by a cumulative 125 basis points. Sujit Kumar, Chief Economist at the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NABFID), highlighted that rising equity and gold prices also generated positive wealth effects, contributing to consumption recovery in late 2025.

Consumption Indicators Strengthen

Official data from the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI) indicated a firming consumption trend through 2025, with Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) growing 7.0 percent in Q1 FY2025-26 and 7.9 percent in Q2 FY2025-26. These figures underscore a noticeable strengthening in household spending, aligning with broader economic momentum. The unprecedentedly soft food prices, often in negative territory through much of 2025, further stabilized spending on essentials, particularly benefiting rural consumption where food forms a larger budget share.
