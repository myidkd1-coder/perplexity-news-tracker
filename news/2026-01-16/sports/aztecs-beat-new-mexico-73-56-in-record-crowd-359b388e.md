## Full Article
SAN DIEGO – Playing in front of a record-breaking crowd of 8,054 fans, the San Diego State women’s basketball team (13-3, 7-0) hit 14 three-pointers on their way to a 73-56 win over New Mexico (12-6,4-3) Wednesday to extend their win streak to nine games.

The Aztecs shot 51% from the floor and 52% from three while holding the Lobos, the top scoring team in the Mountain West, 15 points below their season average. SDSU trailed by as much as nine points in the first half and then went up by 11 in the third quarter only to see the Lobos rally to tie the game in the final minute of the third. SDSU then outscored the Lobos 26-9 to secure the win and improve to 7-0 in Mountain West play.

“Our defense was the key,” Head coach Stacie Terry-Hutson said after the game. “We did a good job of staying in front of their quick guards. If we can defend like that, we’re going to be pretty good.”

SDSU had four players score in double-digits led by Kennedy Lee’s 15 points. She was 5-for-8 from three and was one rebound short of a double-double. Nala Williams had 14 points, five assists, three steals and two blocks. Alyssa Jackson tied a career-high with 11 points and Bailey Barnhard also scored 11.

The Lobos outscored the Aztecs in the first and third quarters, but SDSU had runs of 20-4 and 21-5 to nullify New Mexico’s efforts. SDSU fell behind by nine points in the first quarter but shot 50% from the floor and hit five threes in the second quarter to grab the lead.

The Aztecs lead grew to 11 points midway through the third quarter, but the Lobos responded with a 13-2 run to tie the game at 47-47 late in the quarter. SDSU shot a blistering 9-for-11 in the fourth to win by double-digits, their seventh win by 10 or more points during their nine-game win streak.

New Mexico was led by Destinee Hook’s 18 points. Laila Abdurraqib added 13.

STAT OF THE GAME I

San Diego State was 14-for-27 (51.9%) from three. Their 14 three-pointers tied for the second most in school history.

STAT OF THE GAME II

THE NOTE II

This is the first time since 2011-12 that SDSU has started Mountain West play 7-0. They have never started 8-0.

QUOTE OF THE DAY

“I love the way the community rallies around our women’s basketball program. I love these Field Trip games. It’s loud and I’m grateful for the schools that have bought in and care about coming to our games and San Diego State. This is a great opportunity to expose our university to a bunch of young people.” Head coach Stacie Terry-Hutson
