Calcutta HC Hears ED and TMC Petitions Over I-PAC Raids, ED Moves Supreme Court

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday heard petitions filed by the Enforcement Directorate and the Trinamool Congress related to the agency’s recent raids at the offices of political consultancy firm I-PAC. The ED sought an adjournment, informing the court that it has moved the Supreme Court, while the TMC sought protection for its poll-related data seized during the raids. The party termed the actions “bullying,” while the ED argued the raids had no link to the TMC and alleged interference by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in an ongoing investigation. The HC later disposed of TMC’s petition after noting that no data was seized from the firm’s director, and proceedings are being live-streamed following earlier courtroom chaos.
