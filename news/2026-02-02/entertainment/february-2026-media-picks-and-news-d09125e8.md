Coming to Blu-ray: Loopy De Loop

“Loopy De Loop” is the next Hanna-Barbera series getting a Blu-ray release via Warner Archive. “Loopy” is a series of theatrical shorts Hanna-Barbera produced for Columbia from 1959 to 1965. It was Hanna-Barbera’s only such series for theaters, since theatrical animated shorts were waning in popularity, thanks to television.

The series features Loopy, a French-Canadian wolf whose life mission is to improve the negative reputation of wolves. (His introductory catchphrase: “I am Loopy De Loop, the good wolf.”) Unfortunately, Loopy’s efforts to be helpful are often futile, given everyone he meets assumes the worst about wolves, with slapstick results.

I note in real life, wolf conservation efforts started to gain steam in the 70s, with people realizing the role wolves play in ecology. So maybe Loopy’s efforts weren’t in vain, after all!

Looney Tunes to air on Turner Classic Movies

Turner Classic Movies (TCM) has announced that it’ll begin dedicated airings of “Looney Tunes” shorts in February, with Bugs Bunny declared the month’s star. “Looney Tunes” airings will still continue on Boomerang and MeTV, as well as streaming on Tubi.

TCM is also one of the few cable channels to stay with Warner Bros. under the impending sale to Netflix. It’s good to see the Looney Tunes have a home somewhere on cable besides Boomerang; since Comcast doesn’t carry that channel (for some reason), it’s not available in much of the country.

Yet another Muppets revival

February brings yet another attempt to revive the Muppets via Disney+. This time, it’s a one-shot revival of “The Muppet Show,” produced by Seth Rogan and featuring singer Sabrina Carpenter. Here’s the trailer:

Sports thoughts

This month sees a lot of sporting events, slightly compensating for the lack of much media of interest otherwise. Since Peacock will be carrying much of said coverage, sports fans might want to invest in a subscription for February (and then cancel).

February brings as usual the Super Bowl, this year between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. (I’ll be rooting for the former.) The halftime show this year stars Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, which has already garnered negative attention from the White House (*sigh*).

Also airing this year is the Winter Olympics, taking place in Italy. Peacock will stream all of the events and the opening/closing ceremonies. Since the NHL’s players will be participating, there’ll be no NHL All Star game this year. Fans of the HBO Max/Crave gay hockey romance series “Heated Rivalry” (based on a series of books by Rachel Reid) will be pleased to know the show’s stars are among the Olympic torchbearers.

“Heated Rivalry” has become one of HBO Max’s most popular shows, and is getting a second season. As of this writing, I’m reading the first book in the series (“Game Changer”); I note the books themselves are popular, and have long holds at my local library. I’ll eventually get to the TV show itself, though I’m not sure when. HBO Max’s content removals made me vow not to pay a dime for the streaming service anytime soon, if I can help it.

There’s also plenty of basketball this month. Along with the annual NBA All-Star game on Presidents’ Day weekend, there’s also the debut of “Sunday Night Basketball” on NBC/Peacock. The weekly game will take the place of “Sunday Night Football”’s timeslot, and run through the end of the season in April.
