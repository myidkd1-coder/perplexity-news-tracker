NEW DELHI: India welcomed the New Year 2026 with vibrant celebrations across the country, as people gathered in large numbers to mark the occasion with joy and festivity on Thursday night.Cities came alive with fireworks, cultural events, live music performances, and themed decorations as the nation stepped into another year.The outgoing year, 2025, was remembered for India’s focus on reforms, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.“What makes the reforms of 2025 significant is not only their dimension but also their underlying philosophy. We modernised institutions, simplified governance, and strengthened the foundations for long-term inclusive growth,” he added, noting that his government prioritised collaboration over control and facilitation over regulation “in the true spirit of a modern democracy.”President Droupadi Murmu also extended New Year greetings to citizens in India and abroad, calling the occasion a symbol of renewed energy, positive change and fresh beginnings.“May the year 2026 bring peace, happiness and prosperity into our lives and infuse new energy to build a stronger and more prosperous India,” she said.In Delhi, popular spots including India Gate, Hauz Khas, Connaught Place were bustling with revelers celebrating the arrival of 2026.Ahead of the festivities, the Delhi Police shared a humorous social media post warning against drunk driving, saying, “Kuch Tests me Zero lana hi best hota hai.”In Bengaluru, large crowds of people gathered at the bustling intersections of Mahatma Gandhi Road and Brigade Road.Around five youths, who allegedly misbehaved with women revellers and later with police who questioned them, were detained at Church Street little before midnight. Another youth, in an inebriated condition and seen arguing heatedly with a police inspector at MG Road, was also detained and taken away from the spot.In Punjab, people gathered at the Golden Temple in Amritsar to welcome the New Year, while Mumbai saw large crowds at Juhu Beach, Chowpatty Beach, and Carter Road in Bandra.
