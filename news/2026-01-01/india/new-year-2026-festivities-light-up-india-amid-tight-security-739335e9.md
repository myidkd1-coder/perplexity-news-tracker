India rang in 2026 with grand New Year celebrations as cities tightened security, issued traffic advisories and deployed thousands of police to ensure public safety.

New Delhi: India ushered in the New Year with widespread celebrations, countdown parties and festive gatherings, as state governments across the country tightened security arrangements to ensure the festivities concluded peacefully.

Major metropolitan cities, including Delhi and Mumbai, witnessed massive crowds at prominent landmarks such as India Gate, Connaught Place and Marine Drive, where revellers gathered in large numbers to welcome the New Year, creating a lively and celebratory atmosphere.

Authorities nationwide issued traffic advisories, enforced guidelines for restaurants and hotels, and deployed additional police and security personnel in anticipation of heavy footfall at public venues during New Year celebrations in India.

Despite the cold weather in the national capital, areas such as Connaught Place and Vasant Vihar recorded steady crowds, with families and groups assembling in markets and open spaces to mark the occasion.

Speaking to IANS at Connaught Place, a tourist from Punjab said he had travelled to Delhi to celebrate the New Year and expressed hope for a positive year ahead. Another reveller said the cold weather did little to dampen spirits as people gathered with friends to welcome 2026.

Police officials said elaborate security measures were put in place in crowd-prone areas across Delhi to prevent untoward incidents and maintain law and order during New Year’s Eve celebrations. Security arrangements were monitored by senior officers, including six Assistant Commissioners of Police and an Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police. In Delhi’s West District alone, 1,469 police personnel were deployed to ensure public safety.

In Rajasthan, authorities enforced strict traffic and road safety measures, setting up checkpoints, inspecting vehicles and taking firm action against drunk driving during the New Year celebrations.

In Maharashtra, eateries, restaurants, hotels, orchestra bars and pubs were allowed to remain open until 5 am on January 1, providing extended hours for revellers.

In Bengaluru, around 20,000 police personnel were deployed as more than 10 lakh people were expected to gather across various parts of the city for New Year’s Eve festivities.

Meanwhile, popular hill stations such as Shimla and Manali reported a surge in tourist arrivals, with visitors braving freezing temperatures to ring in the New Year in the mountains, even as parts of the eastern world bid farewell to 2025.
