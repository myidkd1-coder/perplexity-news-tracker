11 Great Action Movies on Hulu Right Now (December 2025): ‘Die Hard’ and More

5. 'Ash' (2025)

Ash is a sci-fi/horror movie that flew way under the radar during its brief theatrical release last year. But for a low-budget flick, it's got some real style as well as star power from its two leads, Eiza González and Aaron Paul. González has the leading role as Riya Ortiz, an astronaut who awakens on a research station in deep space with her crew dead and little memory of what happened or how she came to be there.

Paul plays Brion Cargyle, a man who claims that he was sent to rescue Riva from a distress signal that she sent out. But with her memory on the fritz, Riva is paranoid and distrustful of Brion and his intentions. She may have good reasons to be wary as her memories start to return. But if Riva can't trust Brion, then this space station may turn out to be her tomb.

Ash is now streaming on Hulu.

4. 'Tron: Ares' (2025)

If you've ever wanted to see Jeff Bridges steal a movie out from under everyone, the original Tron star does make his return as Kevin Flynn in Tron: Ares. But for the most part, this film belongs to Jared Leto, who plays the title character, Ares. Julian Dillinger (Evan Peters) created Ares and his colleague Athena (Jodie Turner-Smith) as his personal digital enforcers. He's also given them a way to enter the real world for 29 minutes at a time.

Julian sends the pair after an ENCOM executive, Eve Kim (Greta Lee), out of the belief that she has the key to keeping digital beings and objects permanently in the real world. Athena may follow those orders blindly, but Ares doesn't. He's got an appreciation for humanity and a desire to break free from Julian's control. He may also be Eve's only hope of survival.

Tron: Ares will stream on Disney+ on January 7.

3. 'The Night Manager' (2016, 2026)

A decade is a long time between seasons, but Tom Hiddleston's been busy making movies and two seasons of Loki. The first season of The Night Manager featured Hiddleston in the lead as Jonathan Pine, a former military officer turned hotel night shift manager. British intelligence officer Angela Burr (Olivia Colman) coerced Jonathan to help her take down arms dealer Richard Roper (Hugh Laurie).

Season 2 picks up 10 years later, as Jonathan believes that one of Roper's former allies, Teddy Dos Santos (Diego Calva), is receiving aid from the British government in his arms dealing. To thwart those plans, Jonathan is coming out of retirement and making the journey to Colombia. Camila Morrone also stars as Roxana Bolaños, a woman who has her own reasons to distrust Teddy. But she isn't sure whether she can trust Jonathan either.

The Night Manager season 2 will stream on Prime Video on January 11.

2. 'Wonder Man' (2026)

If you've never heard of Marvel's Wonder Man, it's probably because he's a C-list hero at best who is only known for his stints on the Avengers. The new Wonder Man series on Disney+ may go a long way towards changing that, and it's taking a very meta approach to the concept. On this show, there was already a Wonder Man movie that greatly resembled his comic-book counterpart. Now, actor Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) desperately wants to star in the remake.

In the comics, Simon Williams is Wonder Man, who has superhuman powers as well as aspirations of being a great actor. This version of Simon has the latter, but he will get powers as well at some point. Ben Kingsley is reprising his Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings role as Trevor Slattery. Trevor wants to be Simon's new friend because he knows a star in the making when he sees one. And Trevor is looking for his comeback as well.

Wonder Man will stream on Disney+ on January 27.

1. 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms' (2026)

Game of Thrones fans have been eagerly awaiting the next spinoff prequel series, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, which is based on the popular novellas by George R.R. Martin. This show takes place 90 years before its predecessor, and features Peter Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, or Dunk to his friends. He's a lowborn knight without good social standing.

Dunk soon draws the attention of Prince Aegon Targaryen (Dexter Sol Ansell), a young boy who hides his royal heritage by going by Egg in public. Egg wants to be Dunk's squire, but this duo has some roadblocks ahead of them. Before Dunk can go on a journey with Egg, he'll have to fight for his life in a trial by combat against some of the best warriors in the realm.

A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms will stream on HBO Max on January 18.
