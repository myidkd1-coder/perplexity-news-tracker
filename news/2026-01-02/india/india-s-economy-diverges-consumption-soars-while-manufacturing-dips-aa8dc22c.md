India's Economy Ends 2025 with Divergent Trends

India's economy concluded 2025 marked by a significant divergence between its consumption and production sectors. While consumers demonstrated robust spending, evidenced by record highs in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions, the manufacturing sector experienced a notable slowdown. This trend signals a complex economic landscape as the nation heads into 2026.

High-frequency indicators consistently pointed towards resilient consumer demand. Gross GST collections in December reached ₹1.74 lakh crore, representing a 6.1 percent year-on-year increase. This figure marked the fastest growth pace in three months, following the GST rate rationalisation implemented in September. MS Mani, Partner at Deloitte India, observed that the strong growth indicates consumption has been on an upswing, with volume growth offsetting lower tax rates.

Digital payment platforms provided an even clearer signal of consumption spending and the formalisation of low-ticket transactions. December set a new record for UPI, with transaction volumes touching an all-time high of 21.6 billion. Transaction values also climbed significantly, exceeding previous peaks.

The automobile sector further bolstered the consumption narrative. Maruti Suzuki India Limited recorded a substantial 37 percent jump in passenger vehicle sales. Mahindra & Mahindra Limited's passenger vehicle segment saw a 23 percent rise, with its commercial segments also showing double-digit growth. Tractor maker Escorts Kubota Limited reported a significant 38 percent increase in domestic despatches.

Manufacturing Sector Slowdown

In stark contrast to the buoyancy in consumption, the manufacturing sector showed signs of waning momentum towards the year's end. The seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.0 in December, down from 56.6 in November. This indicates the slowest expansion in manufacturing activity recorded over the past two years, although the index remained above the 50-mark separating expansion from contraction.

Weakening external demand emerged as a key drag on the manufacturing sector. New export orders rose at their slowest pace in 14 months, reflecting softer global demand. Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, noted that the proportion of firms reporting higher export sales in December was approximately half the average observed throughout 2025.

Industrial signals within core sectors presented a mixed picture. Coal India Limited reported a 4.6 percent year-on-year increase in production in December, but its offtake declined by 5.2 percent, hinting at potentially softer near-term industrial demand.

Cautious Business Outlook for 2026

Looking ahead to 2026, manufacturers expressed a cautious optimism. While output expectations for the coming year remained positive, the overall business sentiment index has fallen to its lowest level in nearly three-and-a-half years. This suggests a prevailing sense of uncertainty despite the resilience observed in consumer-driven segments.

Impact

This economic divergence presents a nuanced picture for investors and businesses. Sectors reliant on consumer spending may continue to experience growth, while those exposed to manufacturing and international trade could face headwinds. The declining business sentiment could influence future investment and hiring decisions, potentially moderating overall economic growth.
