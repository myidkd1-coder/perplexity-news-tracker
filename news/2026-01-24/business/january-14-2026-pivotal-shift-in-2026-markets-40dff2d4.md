A Shift in the Landscape

As we begin 2026, following what has been a remarkably strong three-year bull market, I wanted to share my perspective on the changing environment. The easy gains of the recent past have set a high bar, and while the rearview mirror looks fantastic, the road ahead is becoming far more nuanced.

The “Goldilocks” Narrative Gets Complicated

If you tried to trade yesterday’s market based on the headlines alone, you likely ended the day wondering if the ticker tape was broken. The data looked good—a cooler-than-expected CPI print that should have pleased the bulls. Instead, the market gave the news a cold shoulder. We are seeing a classic case of “good news is bad news,” or perhaps more accurately, “good news doesn’t matter if the banks are missing earnings.” As we settle into 2026, the era of easy, momentum-driven returns appears to be fading. The market is asking investors to do something they haven’t had to do in a while: be selective.

Inflation: The Unwanted Guest

The December CPI report was a mixed bag. Headline numbers were acceptable—core CPI increased just 0.2%—but a look under the hood reveals that the “transitory” debate is long dead. Shelter costs are rising (0.4%), and tariff-sensitive sectors like apparel (+0.6%) and airline fares (+5.2%) are flashing warning signs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) noted that it was unable to collect October data due to the government shutdown, which leaves us flying partially blind. It is difficult to navigate a “soft landing” when the instrument panel is flickering, and yesterday’s market wobble reflects that anxiety.

The Banks: A Warning Shot

It is a notable day when JPMorgan Chase, often considered the fortress of Wall Street, leads the market down. The bank missed investment banking fee guidance and saw revenue drops in M&A. When the largest bank in the country sees a slowdown in deal flow, it suggests the “animal spirits” of the corporate world are taking a pause. With other major players like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs reporting later this week, we may be in for a reality check regarding the health of the financial sector.

The Fed: The Long Goodbye

Jerome Powell is playing a long game, and the market is struggling to keep up. The betting markets have all but given up on a January rate cut (now priced at a mere 5% chance), pushing hopes out to April or June. The irony is distinct: the economy is performing well enough (low unemployment, trend-beating growth) that the Fed doesn’t need to cut, yet the market is frustrated because it wants the return of cheap liquidity. We are in a standoff where strong economic health is being punished by investors who are still addicted to the rate-cut cycle.

The End of the AI “Easy Button”

For the last few years, the investment strategy was simple: buy the technology index and watch it rise. Those days are likely over. As we move deeper into 2026, the separation between the AI winners (those monetizing the tech) and the losers (those just burning cash) will become more violent. Competition is heating up, margins are compressing, and the “rising tide lifts all boats” phase is ending. We are entering a stock-picker’s market where execution matters more than hype.

The Geopolitical Risk Premium

While domestic investors obsess over basis points, the real risks may be lurking overseas. Tensions in Iran are spiking oil prices again, acting as a hidden tax on every American consumer. Venezuela remains a wild card for global energy supply, and the situation in China continues to evolve in ways that threaten supply chains. These aren’t just headlines; they are direct threats to the disinflationary trend we have enjoyed.

Policy Wildcards

Closer to home, traders are anxiously awaiting a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this Wednesday regarding tariffs the White House has been enforcing. An adverse ruling could draw a negative market reaction, introducing regulatory uncertainty right as earnings season kicks off. It serves as a reminder that in 2026, government policy is just as big a market mover as corporate earnings.

The Near-Term Outlook: Strength Prevails Despite these crosscurrents, we must remain objective: the U.S. economy remains fundamentally strong. People are employed, consumers are spending, and fiscal stimulus is providing a floor for growth. We expect the next few months to remain positive for the economy, even if the stock market remains choppy as it digests earnings and Fed signaling. The recession that everyone predicted for years still hasn’t arrived.

The Longer View: Buckle Up However, do not mistake resilience for invincibility. While the economy looks good now, we expect volatility to spike as the year progresses. The combination of an uncertain Fed path, a volatile geopolitical map, and a maturing technology cycle suggests that the smooth sailing is behind us. In this environment, the best approach is to increase emphasis on the fundamentals, ensuring client portfolios are filled with great companies with durable business models and defensive moats that can protect profits if these risks manifest into realities. We remain optimistic, but our eyes are wide open to the risks on the horizon.
