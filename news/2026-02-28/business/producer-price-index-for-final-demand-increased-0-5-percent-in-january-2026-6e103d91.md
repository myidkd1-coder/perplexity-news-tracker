Transmission of material in this release is embargoed until USDL 26-0289 8:30 a.m. (ET) Friday, February 27, 2026 Technical information: (202) 691-7705 * ppi-info@bls.gov * www.bls.gov/ppi Media contact: (202) 691-5902 * PressOffice@bls.gov PRODUCER PRICE INDEXES - JANUARY 2026 The Producer Price Index for final demand increased 0.5 percent in January, seasonally adjusted, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Final demand prices advanced 0.4 percent in December 2025 and 0.2 percent in November. (See table A.) On an unadjusted basis, the index for final demand rose 2.9 percent for the 12 months ended January 2026. The January increase in prices for final demand can be traced to a 0.8-percent advance in the index for final demand services. In contrast, prices for final demand goods declined 0.3 percent. The index for final demand less foods, energy, and trade services moved up 0.3 percent in January, the ninth consecutive increase. For the 12 months ended in January, prices for final demand less foods, energy, and trade services rose 3.4 percent. Final Demand Final demand services: The index for final demand services advanced 0.8 percent in January, the largest increase since moving up 0.9 percent in July 2025. Most of the January rise in prices for final demand services can be traced to margins for final demand trade services, which jumped 2.5 percent. (Trade indexes measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.) Prices for final demand transportation and warehousing services advanced 1.0 percent, while the index for final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing was unchanged. Product detail: Over 20 percent of the January increase in prices for final demand services is attributable to a 14.4-percent jump in margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. The indexes for apparel, footwear, and accessories retailing; chemicals and allied products wholesaling; bundled wired telecommunications access services; health, beauty, and optical goods retailing; and food and alcohol retailing also moved higher. Conversely, prices for system software publishing fell 12.2 percent. The indexes for guestroom rental and for apparel wholesaling also decreased. (See table 2. Please note, some indexes listed in tables 1 through 3 of this release have changed due to the previously announced elimination of selected PPI commodity indexes and the PPI weight allocation update. For more information, see www.bls.gov/ppi/notices/2026/ppi- modifies-news-release-tables.htm.) Final demand goods: Prices for final demand goods moved down 0.3 percent in January, the largest decrease since falling 0.7 percent in March 2025. Leading the January decline, the index for final demand energy dropped 2.7 percent. Prices for final demand foods decreased 1.5 percent. In contrast, the index for final demand goods less foods and energy advanced 0.7 percent. Product detail: Nearly 80 percent of the January decline in prices for final demand goods can be traced to the index for gasoline, which fell 5.5 percent. Prices for chicken eggs, electric power, gas fuels, fresh fruits and melons, and ethanol also moved lower. Conversely, the index for search, detection, navigation, and guidance systems jumped 15.5 percent. Prices for nonferrous metals and for pork also rose.

Intermediate Demand by Commodity Type Within intermediate demand in January, prices for processed goods were unchanged, the index for unprocessed goods fell 0.5 percent, and prices for services moved up 0.3 percent. (See tables B and C.) Processed goods for intermediate demand: The index for processed goods for intermediate demand remained unchanged in January. A 0.5-percent increase in prices for processed materials less foods and energy offset declines in the indexes for processed energy goods and for processed foods and feeds, which fell 2.0 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. For the 12 months ended in January, prices for processed goods for intermediate demand rose 2.6 percent. Product detail: Within processed goods for intermediate demand in January, the index for nonferrous metals moved up 4.8 percent. Prices for industrial gases; search, detection, navigation, and guidance systems; paints and allied products; and industrial natural gas also increased. In contrast, the index for gasoline declined 5.5 percent. Prices for commercial electric power, industrial electric power, ethanol, and confectionery materials also fell. Unprocessed goods for intermediate demand: The index for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand moved down 0.5 percent in January after advancing 1.9 percent in December. The decline is attributable to prices for unprocessed foodstuffs and feedstuffs, which decreased 3.5 percent. Conversely, the indexes for unprocessed nonfood materials less energy and for unprocessed energy materials rose 2.6 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. For the 12 months ended in January, prices for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand fell 6.1 percent, the largest 12-month decline since dropping 8.2 percent in September 2024. Product detail: A major factor in the January decline in the index for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand was a 9.8-percent drop in prices for raw milk. The indexes for ungraded chicken eggs, corn, oilseeds, natural gas, and fresh fruits and melons also moved lower. In contrast, prices for nonferrous scrap rose 8.5 percent. The indexes for crude petroleum and for slaughter chickens also advanced.

Services for intermediate demand: Prices for services for intermediate demand increased 0.3 percent in January, the fifth consecutive rise. Leading the January advance, margins for trade services for intermediate demand moved up 1.6 percent. The index for transportation and warehousing services for intermediate demand increased 0.5 percent, while prices for services less trade, transportation, and warehousing for intermediate demand were unchanged. For the 12 months ended in January, the index for services for intermediate demand rose 2.9 percent, the largest 12-month advance since moving up 3.1 percent in December 2024. Product detail: Half of the January increase in prices for services for intermediate demand can be attributed to margins for chemicals and allied products wholesaling, which jumped 8.4 percent. The indexes for staffing services, gross rents for retail properties, legal services, portfolio management, and airline passenger services also rose. Conversely, prices for business loans (partial) fell 7.5 percent. The indexes for arrangement of freight and cargo transportation and for machinery and equipment parts and supplies wholesaling also declined.

Intermediate Demand by Production Flow Stage 4 intermediate demand: The index for stage 4 intermediate demand advanced 0.4 percent in January, the ninth consecutive increase. In January, prices for total services inputs to stage 4 intermediate demand rose 0.6 percent, while the index for total goods inputs was unchanged. (See table D.) Advances in the indexes for chemicals and allied products wholesaling, gross rents for retail properties, staffing services, portfolio management, legal services, and nonferrous metals outweighed decreasing prices for business loans (partial), internet advertising sales, and commercial electric power. For the 12 months ended in January, the index for stage 4 intermediate demand moved up 3.8 percent. Stage 3 intermediate demand: Prices for stage 3 intermediate demand remained unchanged in January. A 0.5-percent rise in the index for total services inputs to stage 3 intermediate demand offset a 0.7-percent decline in prices for total goods inputs. Advances in the indexes for staffing services, nonferrous metals, chemicals and allied products wholesaling, slaughter chickens, and slaughter steers and heifers offset lower prices for raw milk; ungraded chicken eggs; business loans (partial); corn; and securities brokerage, dealing, investment advice, and related services. For the 12 months ended in January, the index for stage 3 intermediate demand increased 0.9 percent. Stage 2 intermediate demand: The index for stage 2 intermediate demand edged up 0.1 percent in January, the third straight increase. In January, prices for total goods inputs to stage 2 intermediate demand advanced 0.2 percent, while the index for total services inputs was unchanged. Increases in the indexes for crude petroleum, staffing services, legal services, nonferrous metals, and chemicals and allied products wholesaling outweighed decreasing prices for business loans (partial), gas fuels, internet advertising sales, and oilseeds. For the 12 months ended in January, the index for stage 2 intermediate demand fell 0.9 percent, the largest 12-month decline since moving down 1.9 percent in September 2024. Stage 1 intermediate demand: Prices for stage 1 intermediate demand increased 0.6 percent in January, the largest advance since moving up 0.9 percent in July 2025. In January, the index for total goods inputs to stage 1 intermediate demand rose 0.7 percent, and prices for total services inputs climbed 0.4 percent. Increases in the indexes for nonferrous metals, chemicals and allied products wholesaling, iron and steel scrap, industrial gases, gross rents for retail properties, and airline passenger services outweighed falling prices for internet advertising sales, ethanol, and gasoline. For the 12 months ended in January, the index for stage 1 intermediate demand advanced 4.0 percent.

________________ The Producer Price Index for February 2026 is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, March 18, 2026, at 8:30 a.m. (ET). ***** Effect of Federal Government Shutdown on PPI Data The Federal government shutdown in October and November 2025 has continued to delay the transmission of Producer Price Index (PPI) price-update requests. Price-update requests asking for information as of the January 13, 2026 pricing date were sent to PPI survey respondents on January 27, 2026. The response rate for January data reflected in this release is within the normal range, and no modifications to PPI methodology or procedures were necessary. The effects of the government shutdown will delay the upcoming PPI data release for February, which is rescheduled for March 18, 2026. The PPI release schedule for 2026 is available at www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/ppi.htm. ***** PPI Recalculates Seasonal Adjustment Factors Effective with this release, Producer Price Index (PPI) seasonal adjustment factors have been recalculated to reflect price-movement patterns during 2025 for the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) system and commodity-grouping indexes. This routine annual recalculation impacts previously published seasonally adjusted indexes and percent changes for January 2021 through December 2025. Updated seasonal indexes and seasonal adjustment factors for January 2021 through December 2025, as well as seasonal factors for directly adjusted commodity indexes to be used through December 2026, have been posted to the BLS website. For updated seasonal factors, visit the PPI webpage at www.bls.gov/ppi/tables. Alternatively, contact the PPI Section of Index Analysis and Public Information at ppi-info@bls.gov or (202) 691-7705. Tables E and F provide seasonally adjusted percent changes for major FD-ID system indexes in 2025, based on former and recalculated seasonal factors. These percent changes are based on PPI data through December 2025, which include final price data through August 2025 and revised interim data for September through November. This differs from values shown in tables A through C of this release for January 2026, which include final price data through September 2025 and revised interim data for October through December.

With this year's update, PPI relative importance figure tables that describe the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) aggregation structure also are impacted by the PPI update to commodity weight allocations for the FD-ID system. (See accompanying notice.) The following information is available on the PPI website at www.bls.gov/ppi/tables/. Relative Importance Figure Tables for December 2025: * Final demand by individual commodities * Final demand by component series * Individual commodities of intermediate demand by commodity type * Component series of intermediate demand by commodity type * Individual commodities of intermediate demand by production flow * Component series of intermediate demand by production flow * Commodities, all levels * Wherever-provided services and construction Seasonal Factor Update: * Direct seasonal factors for PPI commodity indexes for 2026 * Recalculated seasonal factors for the last 5 years (2021-2025) for PPI commodity indexes * Recalculated seasonal factors for the last 5 years (2021-2025) for PPI FD-ID indexes Recalculated seasonal index data for 2021-2025 for the FD-ID and commodity indexes also have been posted to the PPI database on the BLS website. For additional information, contact the PPI Section of Index Analysis and Public Information at ppi-info@bls.gov or (202) 691-7705. ***** PPI Updates Commodity Weight Allocations for the Final Demand-Intermediate Demand Aggregation Structure Effective with this release, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has updated weight allocations used to calculate the Producer Price Index (PPI) Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID) indexes to more accurately reflect recent sales patterns. The new allocations are based primarily on data from the 2017 Input-Output (I-O) Accounts from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The allocations were previously based on the 2012 I-O of Accounts data. PPI commodity index weights continue to be based on shipment values from the 2017 economic census, which were applied in January 2023. It is the proportions of these commodity index weights allocated to the various FD-ID categories, including Final demand, Intermediate demand by commodity type, and Intermediate demand by production flow, that have been updated. This allocation update does not change the PPI commodity classification system, reference base, the FD-ID aggregation structure, or historical index data. It has, however, resulted in substantial shifts in the relative importance figures of certain commodity components that make up the FD- ID indexes. Relative importance figure tables for December 2025, which detail the shift in weight allocations, as well as price movements in 2025, are available at www.bls.gov/ppi/tables/. This information also may be requested from the PPI Section of Index Analysis and Public Information at ppi-info@bls.gov or (202) 691-7705.

Technical Note Brief Explanation of Producer Price Indexes The Producer Price Index (PPI) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a family of indexes that measures the average change over time in prices received (price changes) by producers for domestically produced goods, services, and construction. PPIs measure price change from the perspective of the seller. This contrasts with other measures, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPIs measure price change from the purchaser's perspective. More than 10,000 PPIs for individual products and groups of products are released each month. PPIs are available for the products of virtually every industry in the mining and manufacturing sectors. Over time, new PPIs have been introduced for products of industries in the services and construction sectors of the U.S. economy. As of January 2023, the PPI covered 69 percent of services as measured by 2017 Census revenue, and 17 percent of construction. More than 64,000 price quotations per month are organized into three sets of PPIs: (1) Final demand-Intermediate demand (FD-ID) indexes, (2) commodity indexes, and (3) indexes for the net output of industries and their products. The FD-ID structure organizes products by class of buyer and degree of fabrication as well as by stage of production. The commodity structure organizes products by similarity of end use or product type. The entire output of various industries is sampled to derive price indexes for the net output of industries and their products. Final Demand-Intermediate Demand Indexes The PPI FD-ID structure measures price change for goods, services, and construction sold to final demand and to intermediate demand. The FD-ID system replaced the PPI stage- of-processing (SOP) system as PPI's primary aggregation model with the release of data for January 2014. The FD-ID model expands coverage beyond that of the SOP system through the addition of services, construction, exports, and government purchases. Compared with finished goods under the SOP system, the PPI for final demand goods includes nearly a 50 percent expansion of coverage. This increase can be traced to the addition of government purchases and exports. For overall final demand, expansion to include final demand services represents an even larger increase in coverage. In December 2022, final demand goods were about 30.7 percent of overall final demand, final demand services were roughly 66.6 percent, and final demand construction was about 2.7 percent of final demand. Within intermediate demand, coverage of services for intermediate demand resulted in about a 45 percent increase in coverage of the intermediate demand portion of the economy. FD-ID indexes are constructed from commodity-based producer output price indexes. Commodities are allocated to aggregate indexes primarily based on the type of buyer. The main source of data used to determine the type of buyer is the "Use of commodities by industries, before redefinition," table from the Benchmark Input-Output Accounts of the U.S. In many cases, the same commodity is purchased by different types of buyers. As a result, commodities are often included in several FD-ID indexes. For example, regular gasoline is purchased for personal consumption, export, government use, and business use. The PPI program publishes only one commodity index for regular gasoline (wpu057104), reflecting sales to all types of buyers, and this index is used in all aggregations regardless of whether the gasoline is sold for personal consumption, as an export, to government, or to businesses. Proportions based on BEA "Use of Commodities" data are used to allocate the correct portion of the total weight of gasoline to each use category. In cases when buyer type is an important price determining characteristic, indexes are created based on specific buyer type. For example, within the PPI category for loan services, separate indexes for consumer loans and business loans were constructed. For more information relating to the FD-ID structure, see "A new, experimental system of indexes from the PPI program" in the February 2011 Monthly Labor Review. Final Demand: The final demand portion of the FD-ID structure measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export. The system is composed of six main price indexes: final demand goods; final demand trade services; final demand transportation and warehousing services; final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing; final demand construction; and overall final demand. The final demand goods index measures price change for both unprocessed and processed goods sold to final demand. Fresh fruits sold to consumers and computers sold for capital investment are examples of transactions included in the final demand goods price index. The final demand trade services index measures price change for the retailing and wholesaling of merchandise sold to final demand, generally without transformation. (Trade indexes measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.) The final demand transportation and warehousing services index tracks price change for transportation of passengers, as well as, transportation of cargo sold to final demand, and also includes prices for warehousing and storage of goods sold to final demand. The final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing index measures price change for all services other than trade and transportation sold to final demand. Publishing, banking, lodging, and health care are examples of these services. The final demand construction index tracks price change for new construction, as well as maintenance and repair construction sold to final demand. Construction of office buildings is an example of a commodity that would be included in the final demand construction index. Lastly, the overall final demand index tracks price change for all types of commodities sold to final demand by combining the five final demand component indexes described above. Intermediate Demand: The intermediate demand portion of the FD-ID system tracks price change for goods, services, and construction products sold to businesses as inputs to production, excluding capital investment. The system includes two parallel treatments of intermediate demand. The first treatment organizes intermediate demand commodities by type. The second organizes intermediate demand commodities into production stages, with the explicit goal of developing a forward-flow model of production and price change. The intermediate demand by commodity type portion of the system organizes commodities by similarity of product. The system is composed of six main price indexes: unprocessed goods for intermediate demand; processed goods for intermediate demand; intermediate demand trade services; intermediate demand transportation and warehousing services; intermediate demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing; and intermediate demand construction. The unprocessed goods for intermediate demand price index measures price change for goods sold to businesses as inputs to production that have undergone no fabrication. Crude petroleum sold to refineries is an example of an unprocessed good sold to intermediate demand. The processed goods for intermediate demand index tracks price change for fabricated goods sold as business inputs. Examples include car parts sold to car manufacturers and gasoline sold to trucking companies. The index for trade services for intermediate demand measures price change for the services of retailing and wholesaling goods purchased by businesses as inputs to production. The intermediate demand transportation and warehousing services index measures price change for business travel, as well as, transportation and warehousing of cargo sold to intermediate demand. The intermediate demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing index measures price change for services other than trade, transportation, and warehousing sold as inputs to production. Legal and accounting services purchased by businesses are examples of intermediate demand services excluding trade, transportation, and warehousing. Finally, the construction for intermediate demand index measures price change for construction purchased by firms as inputs to production. The index for construction for intermediate demand tracks price change for maintenance and repair construction purchased by firms. The production flow treatment of intermediate demand is a stage-based system of price indexes. These indexes can be used to study price transmission across stages of production and final demand. This system is constructed in a manner that maximizes forward flow of production between stages, while minimizing back-flow of production. The production flow treatment contains four main indexes: intermediate demand stage 1, intermediate demand stage 2, intermediate demand stage 3, and intermediate demand stage 4. Indexes for the four stages were developed by first assigning each industry in the economy to one of four stages of production, where industries assigned to the fourth stage primarily produce output consumed as final demand, industries in the third stage primarily produce output consumed by stage 4 industries, industries assigned to the second stage primarily produce output consumed by stage 3 industries, and industries assigned to the first stage produce output primarily consumed by stage 2 industries. The four indexes then track prices for the net inputs consumed by industries in each of the four stages of production. The stage 4 intermediate demand index, for example, tracks price change for inputs consumed, but not produced, by industries included in the fourth stage of production. Hence, the index tracks price change in inputs to industries that primarily produce final demand commodities (stage 4 producers primarily produce commodities sold to final demand). Examples of heavily weighted goods-producing industries in stage 4 include the manufacture of light trucks and utility vehicles, automobiles, and pharmaceuticals. Retail trade, food service and drinking places, and hospitals are examples of heavily weighted service industries included in stage 4. Stage 4 also includes all new construction industries. Examples of goods consumed by stage 4 industries include motor vehicle parts, commercial electric power, plastic construction products, biological products, and beef and veal. Engineering services, machinery and equipment wholesaling, long distance motor carrying, and legal services constitute examples of services consumed by stage 4 industries. Examples of highly weighted goods-producing industries included in stage 3 are motor vehicle parts manufacturing, animal (except poultry) slaughtering and processing, and semiconductor manufacturing. Services industries classified in stage 3 include wholesale trade; insurance carriers; architecture, engineering, and related services; and hotels and motels. Examples of goods consumed by stage 3 industries include slaughter steers and heifers, industrial electric power, and hot rolled steel bars, plates, and structural shapes. Services commonly consumed by stage 3 industries include commissions from sales of property and casualty insurance, business loans, temporary help services, and administrative and general management consulting services. Petroleum refineries; electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; natural gas distribution; cattle ranching and farming; and plastic materials and resin manufacturing are among the goods-based industries assigned to stage 2. Services industries that are heavily weighted in stage 2 include management of companies and enterprises; non-depository credit intermediation; insurance agencies and brokerages; and services to buildings and dwellings. Goods commonly purchased by stage 2 industries include crude oil, natural gas, formula feeds, and primary basic organic chemicals. Services that are heavily weighted in the intermediate demand stage 2 index are legal services, business loans, and cellular phone and other wireless telecommunication. Goods producing industries in stage 1 include oil and gas extraction, paper mills, and grain farming. Real estate, legal services, and advertising services are examples of highly weighted services industries included in stage 1. Examples of goods consumed by stage 1 industries are commercial and industrial electric power and gasoline. Services commonly consumed by stage 1 industries include solid waste collection, chemicals and allied products wholesaling, and guestroom or unit rental. It should be noted that all inputs purchased by stage 1 industries are by definition produced either within stage 1 or by latter stages of processing, leaving stage 1 less useful for price transmission analysis. For additional information on industry stage assignments, see www.bls.gov/ppi/ fd-id/ppi-intermediate-demand-by-production-flow-industry-stage-assignments.htm. Comparing the PPI with CPI Although some data users utilize the PPI as a potential indicator of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), there are many reasons why the PPI and the CPI may diverge. The scope of the personal consumption portion of the PPI includes all marketable output sold by domestic producers for households. The scope of the CPI includes goods and services provided by business or government, where explicit user charges are paid by consumers. For example, the most heavily weighted item in the CPI, owners' equivalent rent, is excluded from the PPI. The scope of the CPI includes imports. The PPI excludes imports. The CPI only includes components of personal consumption directly paid for by the consumers, while the PPI includes components of personal consumption that may not be paid for by consumers. For example, the PPI includes medical services paid for by third parties. In contrast to CPI, PPI does not completely cover services. PPIs exclude taxes, since they do not represent producer revenue. Conversely, sales and other taxes paid by consumers are part of household expenditure and are included in the CPI. Additional technical differences between PPI and CPI also exist. For more information see "Comparing new final demand producer price indexes with other Government price indexes," Monthly Labor Review, January 2014, at www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/. Commodity Indexes The commodity classification of the PPI organizes goods, services, and construction by similarity of product or end use, disregarding industry of origin. With the release of data for July 2009, PPI expanded its commodity structure to include indexes for services and construction products. Prior to this date, the PPI commodity structure only included products from goods producing sectors. Table 9 of the PPI Detailed Report includes data for commodity indexes, organized in a hierarchal structure, including major groupings, subgroups, product classes, sub-product classes, and individual items. Industry Net-Output Price Indexes PPIs for the net output of industries and their products are grouped according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Prior to the release of January 2004, industry-based PPIs were published according to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Industry price indexes are compatible with other economic time series organized by industry, such as data on employment, wages, and productivity. Table 11 of the PPI Detailed Report includes data for NAICS industries and industry groups (3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-digit codes), Census product classes (7- and 8-digit codes), products (9-digit codes), more detailed sub-products (11-digit codes), and, for some industries, indexes for other sources of revenue. Indexes may represent one of three kinds of product categories. Every industry has primary product indexes that show changes in prices received by establishments classified in the industry for products made primarily, but not necessarily exclusively, by that industry. The industry classification of an establishment is determined by which products make up a plurality of its total shipment value. In addition, most industries have secondary product indexes that show changes in prices received by establishments for products chiefly made in some other industry. Some industries have miscellaneous receipts indexes that track price changes for other sources of revenue received by establishments within the industry that are not derived from sales of their products; for example, resales of purchased materials, or revenues from parking lots owned by a manufacturing plant. Data Collection PPIs are constructed using selling prices reported by establishments of all sizes, selected by probability sampling, with the probability of selection proportionate to size. Individual items and transaction terms also are chosen by probability proportionate to size. BLS strongly encourages cooperating companies to supply actual transaction prices at the time of shipment to minimize the use of list prices. Prices submitted by survey respondents are effective on the Tuesday of the week containing the 13th day of the month. The survey is conducted online via the BLS Internet Data Collection Facility (IDCF).) Data provided by survey respondents are supplemented with data from other sources for some areas. Price data are provided by survey respondents on a voluntary and confidential basis; only sworn BLS employees are allowed access to individual company price reports. BLS publishes price indexes, not actual prices. All PPIs are subject to monthly revisions up to 4 months after original publication to reflect the availability of late reports and corrections by respondents. BLS periodically updates the PPI sample of survey respondents to better reflect current conditions when the structure, membership, technology, or product mix of an industry shifts significantly and to spread reporting burden among smaller firms. Information on these resampling efforts are noted in the PPI News Release and PPI Detailed Report in the months they occur. As part of an ongoing effort to expand coverage to sectors of the economy other than mining and manufacturing, an increasing number of service and construction sector industries have been introduced into the PPI. The following is a list of service and construction sector industries introduced into the Producer Price Index, organized by SIC or NAICS code at their date of introduction, and the PPI Detailed Report issue that announced their introduction.

such as FD-ID indexes, currently reflect 2017 values of shipments as reported in the Census of Manufactures and other sources. From January 2018 to December 2022, PPI weights were derived from 2012 shipment values. Industry indexes now are calculated under the 2022 NAICS structure utilizing 2017 value of shipment weights and 2012 net output ratios. The periodic update of the value weights used to calculate the PPI is done to more accurately reflect changes in production and marketing patterns in the economy. Net output values of shipments are used as weights for industry indexes. Net output values refer to the value of shipments from establishments within the industry to buyers outside the industry. However, weights for commodity indexes are based on gross shipment values, including values of shipments between establishments within the same industry. As a result, broad commodity grouping indexes, such as the PPI for All Commodities (which is composed of major commodity groupings 01 through 15), are affected by the multiple counting of price change at successive stages of processing, which can lead to exaggerated or misleading signals about inflation. The intermediate demand by commodity type FD-ID indexes partially correct for this defect, but industry indexes, final demand FD-ID indexes, and intermediate demand by production flow FD-ID indexes consistently correct for this at all levels of aggregation. Therefore, industry and FD-ID indexes are more appropriate than broad commodity groupings for analysis of general price trends. Price Index Reference Base Effective with publication of January 1988 data, many important PPI series (including most commodity groups and individual items) were placed on a new reference base, 1982 = 100. From 1971 through 1987, the standard reference base for most PPI series was 1967 = 100. Except for rounding differences, the shift to the new reference base did not alter any previously published percent changes for affected PPI series. (See "Calculating Index Changes," below.) The 1982 reference base is not used for commodity indexes with a base later than December 1981 or for industry net output indexes and their products. The FD- ID indexes typically have a reference base of November 2009 = 100. For further information on the underlying concepts and methodology of the Producer Price Index, see chapter 14, "Producer Prices," in the BLS Handbook of Methods. This chapter can be downloaded from the BLS Web site at www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch14.htm. Calculating Index Changes Each PPI measures price changes from a reference period that equals 100.0. An increase of 5.5 percent from the reference period in the Final Demand Goods Price Index, for example, is shown as 105.5. This change also can be expressed in dollars, as follows: prices received by domestic producers of a sample of final demand goods have risen from $100 in November 2009 to $105.50. Likewise, a current index of 90.0 would indicate that prices received by producers of final demand goods are 10 percent lower than they were in November 2009. Movements of price indexes from one month to another are usually expressed as percent changes, rather than as changes in index points. Index point changes are affected by the level of the index in relation to its base period, whereas percent changes are not. The following example shows the computation of index point and percent changes. Index point change Final Demand Goods Price Index 107.5 Less previous index 104.0 Equals index point change 3.5 Index percent change Index point change 3.5 Divided by the previous index 104.0 Equals 0.034 Result multiplied by 100 0.034 x 100 Equals percent change 3.4 Seasonally Adjusted and Unadjusted Data Because price data are used for different purposes by different groups, BLS publishes seasonally adjusted and unadjusted changes each month. Seasonally adjusted data are preferred for analyzing general price trends in the economy because these data eliminate the effect of changes that normally occur at about the same time, and in about the same magnitude, every year-such as price movements resulting from normal weather patterns, regular production and marketing cycles, model changeovers, seasonal discounts, and holidays. For these reasons, seasonally adjusted data more clearly reveal underlying trends. Unadjusted data are of primary interest to users who need information that can be related to actual dollar values of transactions. Individuals requiring this information include marketing specialists, purchasing agents, budget and cost analysts, contract specialists, and commodity traders. It is the unadjusted data that are generally cited when escalating long-term contracts such as purchasing agreements or real estate leases. For more information, see Price Adjustment Guide for Contracting Parties, on the Web at www.bls.gov/ppi/publications/price-adjustment-guide-for-contracting- parties.htm. Seasonal adjustment is accomplished using X-13 ARIMA, a software package published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Each year, the seasonal status of most commodity indexes is reevaluated to reflect more recent price behavior. Industry net output indexes are not seasonally adjusted. For time series that exhibit seasonal pricing patterns, new seasonal factors are estimated and applied to the unadjusted data from the prior 5 years. Updated seasonally adjusted indexes replace the most recent 5 years of seasonal data. Seasonal factors may be applied to series using either a direct or an aggregative method. Generally, commodity indexes are seasonally adjusted using direct seasonal adjustment, which produces a more complete elimination of seasonal movements than does the aggregative method. However, the direct seasonal adjustment process may not yield figures that possess additive consistency. Thus, a seasonally adjusted index for a broad category that is directly adjusted may not be logically consistent with all seasonally adjusted indexes for its components. Seasonal movements for FD-ID indexes are derived indirectly through an aggregative method that combines movements of a wide variety of subproduct class (six-digit) series. Seasonally adjusted indexes can become problematic when previously stable and predictable price patterns abruptly change. If the new pattern persists, the seasonal adjustment method will eventually reflect it; if the pattern keeps shifting, however, seasonally adjusted data will become chronically troublesome. This problem occurs relatively infrequently for farm and food-related products, but has more often affected manufactured products such as automobiles and steel. Since January 1988, the PPI has used Intervention Analysis Seasonal Adjustment methods to enhance the calculation of seasonal factors. With this technique, outlier values that may distort the seasonal pattern are removed from the data prior to applying the standard seasonal factor estimation procedure. For example, a possible economic cause for large price movements for petroleum-based products might have been the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, intervention techniques allowed for better estimates of seasonally adjusted data. On the whole, very few series have required intervention. Out of over 400 seasonally adjusted commodity series, 69 were subject to intervention in 2023. For more information relating to seasonal adjustment methods, see "PPI and CPI Seasonal Adjustment: an Update" in the July 2010 Monthly Labor Review, and "PPI and CPI Seasonal Adjustment During the COVID-19 Pandemic" in the May 2022 Monthly Labor Review. Producer Price Index Data on the Internet In 1995, the BLS began posting PPI series, news releases, and technical information to the internet. There were more than 13 million instances of PPI data being downloaded from the BLS website during 2022. Retrieving PPI data from the PPI Web site PPI data can be obtained online (www.bls.gov/ppi). On this page, under the tab labeled "Featured PPI databases" links provide the following methods of data retrieval: Top Picks is a form-based application for both Industry Data and Commodity Data that allows the user to quickly obtain PPI time series data by selecting the high-level aggregate and other commonly requested time series, including the All Commodities Index and the FD-ID indexes (for example, Final Demand). Within each list, any one-or all-of the time series shown can be selected. A user can modify the date range and output options after executing the query, using the reformat button above the data output table. One-Screen Data Search and Multi-Screen Data Search are form-based query applications for both Industry Data and Commodity Data designed for users unfamiliar with the PPI coding structure. These applications guide a user through the PPI classification by listing index titles and do not require knowledge of commodity or industry codes. Data retrieved are based on a query formulated by selecting data characteristics from lists provided. Two options are available to create customized tables, depending on a user's browser capability. The one-screen option is a JavaScript application that uses a single screen to guide a user through the available time series data. The second option is a multiple-screen, non-Java-based application. Both methods allow a user to browse the PPI coding structure and select multiple series. Users can modify the date range and output options after executing the query using the reformat button above the data output table. Series Report is a form-based application that allows users to input multiple, formatted PPI time series identifiers (commodity or industry codes) as inputs in extracting data according to a specified set of date ranges and output options. This application provides the most efficient path for users who are familiar with the format of PPI time series identifiers. There are five alphabetic prefixes used to create unique PPI time series identifiers: WP, WD, PC, PD, and ND. Each provides the user access to a different PPI database. Adding either a "u" (not seasonally adjusted) or an "s" (seasonally adjusted) to the end of these prefixes further specifies the type of data needed. Examples are provided below. For commodity and FD-ID indexes, series identifiers combine a "wpu" prefix (not seasonally adjusted) or a "wps" prefix (seasonally adjusted) with a commodity code. Commodity code Provides data for: wps141101 Passenger cars, seasonally adjusted wpu141101 Passenger cars, not seasonally adjusted wpufd4 Final demand, not seasonally adjusted wpsid63 Services for intermediate demand, seasonally adjusted For discontinued commodity indexes, series identifiers combine a "wdu" prefix (not seasonally adjusted) or a "wds" prefix (seasonally adjusted) with a commodity code. Commodity code Provides data for: wds019 Other farm products, seasonally adjusted wdu0635 Preparations, ethical (prescription), not seasonally adjusted wdusi138011 Stainless steel mill products, not seasonally adjusted Current price indexes grouped by industry according to NAICS have series identifiers that begin with the prefix "pcu." After the prefix, there are 12 digits (the 6-digit industry code is listed twice) followed by up to 7 alphanumeric characters identifying product detail. Dashes are used as placeholders for higher-level industry group codes. Industry-product code, current NAICS series Provides data for: pcu325---325--- Chemical manufacturing pcu336110336110 Automobile and light duty motor vehicle manufacturing pcu621111621111411 Offices of physicians, one- and two-physician practices and single-specialty group practices, general/family practice Discontinued industry-product codes based on SIC combine a "pdu" prefix and "#" between the fourth and fifth characters of the product code. Series identifiers for the discontinued dataset use underscores as placeholders to complete a reference to an SIC industry group code of fewer than four digits. (All PPI industry-based indexes organized by SIC were discontinued with the introduction of NAICS in 2004.) Industry-product code, discontinued SIC series Provides data for: pdu28_ _# Chemicals and allied products pdu331_# Blast furnaces, steel works, and rolling and finishing mills pdu3711#111 Passenger cars Price indexes for discontinued series grouped by industry according to NAICS have identifiers that begin with the prefix "ndu." After the prefix, there are 12 numeric digits (the 6-digit industry code is listed twice), and up to 7 additional alphanumeric characters that identify product detail. Dashes are used as placeholders for higher- level group codes. Industry-product code, discontinued NAICS series Provides data for ndu212231212231 Lead and zinc ore mining ndu2122312122312 Lead, zinc concentrates ndu212231212231214 Lead concentrates Text Files are best suited for users requiring access to either a large volume of time series data or other PPI-related documentation, such as seasonal factor tables and relative importance tables.
