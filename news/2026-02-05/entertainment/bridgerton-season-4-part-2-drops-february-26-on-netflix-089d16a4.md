Another month, another huge month for Netflix, thanks to the addition of one of the best TV shows of all time.

In February, the streaming service won’t just be removing a bunch of titles, but adding even more, with new films and TV series arriving every day.

Among the new original releases are the return of smash hit series The Night Agent, the next show from Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee (How to Get to Heaven from Belfast) and the concluding chapter of Bridgerton season four. There’ll also be documentaries about Gordon Ramsay, Lucy Letby and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder (Matter of Time).

But the biggest addition is the long-running medical drama ER, which has seen a resurgence thanks to the Emmy-winning success of The Pitt, both starring Noah Wyle.

All 15 seasons of the series, which was created by Michael Crichton and launched George Clooney to fame in the 1990s, will become available to stream on Netflix during the coming weeks.

The show is set in the emergency room of a Chicago hospital, and is regularly cited as one of the best and most influential shows of all time. To this day, it’s considered the definitive medical drama.

Find the full list of every movie and TV series being added to Netflix in February below – we compiled this list with assistance from What’s on Netflix.
