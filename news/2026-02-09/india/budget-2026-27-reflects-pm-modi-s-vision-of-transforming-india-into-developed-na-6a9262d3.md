Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu said the Union Budget 2026-27 reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047 under the Viksit Bharat programme. Addressing a press conference in Rajamahendravaram yesterday, the Union Minister said India’s steady 7% growth rate demonstrates the strength of the Prime Minister’s leadership.

He said the country has emerged as the world’s fourth-largest economy despite adverse global conditions. Mr Naidu said the Budget was framed after considering the views and aspirations of millions of young people, as stated by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament. He added that it focuses on long-term national development beyond political considerations.

The Minister Naidu said key sectors such as manufacturing, biopharma, sports goods and information technology have received significant allocations. Projects like the Rare Earth Magnet Corridor and high-speed railway corridors will provide major benefits to Andhra Pradesh, he added. He said the UDAN scheme has made air travel affordable, while the removal of customs duty on critical aircraft components will boost domestic aircraft manufacturing.

Mr Ram Mohan Naidu said the Budget has also provided adequate funds for the Polavaram project, Amaravati construction and the Visakhapatnam Railway Zone. He added that Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is taking firm steps, with Central support, to position Andhra Pradesh among the country’s top states by 2047.
