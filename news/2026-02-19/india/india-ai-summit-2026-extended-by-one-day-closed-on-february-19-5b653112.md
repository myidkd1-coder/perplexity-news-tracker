Why the Expo is 'closed' on February 19

In a move to manage ‘record-breaking’ crowds and accommodate high-profile diplomatic events, the government has announced a major change to the schedule of the India AI Expo 2026. The exhibition, currently held at Bharat Mandapam, will remain closed to the general public on Thursday, February 19. However, to make up for the closure, the government has officially extended the expo by an additional day, meaning it will now remain open until Saturday, February 21.“The expo has been extended by a day due to huge enthusiasm,” said S. Krishnan, Secretary of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), as per multiple reports. He added that the decision was made to ensure a “smoother and more comfortable experience” for the tens of thousands of visitors eager to see the latest in artificial intelligence.The closure is due to a series of restricted-access events involving world leaders and top-tier security protocols. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to officially inaugurate the India AI Impact Summit on the morning of February 19.The day will be packed with high-stakes diplomacy and industrial strategy. These events include addresses by PM Modi, the President of France, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations; a private walkthrough of the pavilions by the PM and visiting Heads of State at 11:00 am; a meeting at noon to discuss global AI governance and infrastructure, and n evening session at 5:30 pm connecting government leaders with the world’s most powerful tech executives.Apart from extending a day, the government has also extended the daily visiting hours until 8:00 pm.The Summit will bring together more than 500 Global AI Leaders, including CEOs/CXOs, around 100 CEOs and Founders, 150 Academicians and Researchers, and 400 CTOs, VPs, and Philanthropists.
