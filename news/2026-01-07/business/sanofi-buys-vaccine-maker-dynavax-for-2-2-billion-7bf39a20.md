Happy new year, Business Watch readers!

Our business and policy reporters spent a good amount of December speaking to experts about what’s to come in 2026. We posted their pieces about the US, Europe, and China on Jan. 2, and the entire package today. Check it out then.

Of course, no amount of prognostication can predict events such as the US incursion into Venezuela to extract the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. While most business press coverage has been about the implications for the oil industry, C&EN reporter Alex Tullo is digging into the potential impact on chemicals. His story will post on our website shortly.

Shifting gears, it turns out that 2025 was a slightly off year for drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration. A new analysis by C&EN reporter Bethany Halford finds that the drug agency approved 46 new molecular entities last year, 4 fewer than in 2024.

Business in brief

Domo Chemicals seeks insolvency in Germany

Citing economic and competitive pressures, the German subsidiaries of the Belgium polymer and chemical maker Domo Chemicals have filed for insolvency. The German law firm Flöther & Wissing has been appointed administrator for the operations. The wages of the 585 workers at the sites have been guaranteed for 3 months. In Leuna, Germany, Domo produces the nylon 6 intermediate caprolactam as well as phenol, acetone, cumene, cyclohexanone, and ammonium sulfate. In Premnitz, Germany, Domo makes nylon 6 resins. The administrator is looking at options such as securing an investor or settling with creditors. Domo attempted a restructuring in 2024, but talks broke down. Domo says its business has been hampered by weak demand, high energy costs, and imports from China. Another European caprolactam maker, Fibrant, which operates in Geleen, the Netherlands, has also been evaluating options, including a major reorganization.

Arkema to sell Dutch plant to India’s Praana

The French chemical maker Arkema plans to sell a plastics impact modifier and processing aid business to the Indian firm Praana for an undisclosed sum. The business had sales of about $52 million in 2024 and employs 50 people at a plant in Vlissingen, the Netherlands. Arkema is keeping a similar plant in Mobile, Alabama. Praana is one of several Indian firms that have been expanding through acquisition in Europe and the US. The Dutch facility will become part of Praana’s Galata Chemicals unit, a US-based plastics additives maker. Praana also owns Sterling Specialty Chemicals, which recently agreed to acquire part of Halliburton’s US oil field chemical business.

NextChem to acquire chemical engineering rival Ballestra

NextChem, part of the Italian engineering firm Maire, has agreed to acquire Ballestra Group, a Milan-based chemical engineering firm, for close to $150 million. Ballestra, which has about 450 employees, is known for designing plants that make detergents, surfactants, and oleochemicals. Ballestra is also active in fluorine derivatives and gas-liquid reactors for specialty chemical production through its Buss ChemTech subsidiary, which it acquired in 2021. Maire CEO Alessandro Bernini says in a press release that Ballestra will advance NextChem’s goal of enabling decarbonization through new technologies. Maire also anticipates cross-selling opportunities with its Tecnimont engineering and construction business.

KPPC to make semiconductor materials in Arizona

KPPC Advanced Chemicals has broken ground on a $120 million plant in Casa Grande, Arizona, that will produce ultra-high-purity chemicals for semiconductor manufacturing. When complete at the end of 2027, the facility will make chemicals used in semiconductor production steps such as wafer cleaning, etching, chemical mechanical planarization, and photolithography. It will supply the chemicals to customers such as Intel, Micron, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), that are investing in the US as part of a government-backed effort to reshore chip production. KPPC, a unit of the Japanese firm Kanto Chemical, intends to invest about $500 million at the site by 2035.

Low-carbon ammonia facility is starting up in Texas

A plant in Beaumont, Texas, has started producing ammonia from natural gas and will begin capturing by-product carbon dioxide for sequestration later this year. OCI built the low-carbon ammonia plant, which has annual capacity of 1.1 million metric tons, and is transferring it to the Australian energy firm Woodside Energy as part of a previously announced $2.35 billion deal. Some firms, such as ExxonMobil, have delayed plans for US production of low-carbon ammonia, but others have persisted. Last year, CF Industries Holdings started low-carbon ammonia production in Donaldsonville, Louisiana.

Bruker unit to supply gamma ray source for EU nuclear physics instrument

RI Research Instruments, a scientific equipment maker majority owned by Bruker, has won a $40 million contract to supply a gamma radiation source and supporting equipment for the Extreme Light Infrastructure–Nuclear Physics facility in Romania. The instrument will probe phenomena including nuclei formation under conditions that mimic the early universe. The radiation source focuses accelerated electron beams and high-powered lasers to a single point, where their collision releases gamma rays in a process known as inverse Compton scattering. “Delivering intense, monochromatic gamma beams from 1 to 20 MeV puts us in a uniquely strong global position,” project director Călin A. Ur says in a press release. “Researchers are already lining up to conduct their most demanding experiments here in Romania.”

Explosion at Elkem silicones facility kills 2 workers

Two Elkem employees died and two were hospitalized after a Dec. 22 explosion at the firm’s silicones pilot lab in a facility near Lyon, France. The site, in the Lyon suburb of Saint-Fons, develops and manufactures silicone products including oils, rubbers, sealants, and adhesives and employs a total of 570 people. Both the company and French authorities are investigating the cause of the accident. “I wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of our colleagues who lost their lives,” CEO Helge Aasen says in a press release. “Our company is in shock at the loss of two valued colleagues.”

Mantel plans borate-based carbon capture in Canada

Mantel Capture has begun an engineering design study for a facility that would capture 60,000 metric tons (t) per year of carbon dioxide from an unnamed oil and gas producer in Alberta, Canada. Mantel, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spin-off that raised $30 million in funding in 2024, uses a borate salt to capture CO 2 in the high-temperature environment found in many industrial plants. The process recovers process heat as steam. Mantel is also building a demonstration project at Kruger’s pulp and paper mill in Quebec that will capture 2,000 t of CO 2 per year. In addition, Mantel says, it is working with partners in industries such as chemicals, cement, steel, and power generation.

AbbVie buys lung cancer candidate from Chinese firm

AbbVie has acquired alveltamig, a biologic molecule designed to treat small-cell-lung cancers (SCLCs), from China’s Zejing Biopharmaceutical. According to a Chinese language filing by the firm (PDF), AbbVie paid $100 million up front to license the molecule, which targets delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), outside China. Alveltamig, also known as ZG006, is a trispecific T-cell engager that binds two distinct DLL3 epitopes on cancer cells and then grabs a T cell by its CD3 protein complex. DLL3 is expressed in over 70% of SCLCs, as well as in other neuroendocrine tumors.

Shionogi buys approved ALS drug for $2.5 billion

The Japanese drug company Shionogi has acquired Radicava, a small-molecule treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), from Tanabe Pharma for $2.5 billion up front plus possible royalties on future sales. The US Food and Drug Administration approved Radicava, which is known generically as edaravone, in 2017. Shionogi says it is establishing itself in the rare diseases arena; it partnered with Maze Therapeutics on that company’s Pompe disease drug in 2024.

Sanofi buys vaccine maker for $2.2 billion

The French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi is slated to buy Dynavax Technologies, a maker of vaccines for hepatitis B and shingles, in a deal that values the US firm at $2.2 billion. Dynavax’s hepatitis B vaccine, Heplisav-B, was approved in the US for adults in September 2024. It brought in $79.3 million in the third quarter of 2025. Analysts say Dynavax’s vaccine could eventually overtake other adult hepatitis B vaccines because it is given over two doses in the span of a month, whereas others require three doses over 6 months. Leerink Partners stock analyst David Risinger called the acquisition a “smart strategic move” by Sanofi in a research note the day of the announcement.
