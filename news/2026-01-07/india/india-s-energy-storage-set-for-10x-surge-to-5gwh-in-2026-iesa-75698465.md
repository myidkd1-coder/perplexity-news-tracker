## Summary
India's battery energy storage capacity projected to surge nearly tenfold to 5 GWh in 2026 from 507 MWh in 2025, driven by project backlogs and tenders. Key projects include Adani Green's massive Gujarat installation; challenges in financing low-tariff bids.

Execution Surge Expected

India's energy storage sector is poised for a significant expansion in 2026, with battery energy storage capacity additions expected to reach approximately 5 GWh. This represents a near tenfold increase from the 507 MWh installed in 2025. The surge is attributed to a substantial volume of projects that, following record tendering activity in 2025, are now entering the execution phase.

In 2025, the market saw 69 tenders issued for a total of 102 GWh, nearly matching the cumulative tenders from 2018 to 2024. This unprecedented tendering activity is now translating into commissioned assets, with typical project timelines spanning 18-24 months. The industry is transitioning from announcing projects to delivering them operationally. This year will be a critical test of the sector's ability to execute.

Tariff Collapse and Competition

The year 2025 was marked by a dramatic decrease in energy storage tariffs, astonishing the industry. Standalone 2-hour Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) saw tariffs plummet from Rs 2.21 lakh per MW per month in early 2025 to Rs 1.48 lakh per MW per month by year-end, as seen in an APTRANSCO tender. Solar-plus-BESS projects experienced similar price drops, with tariffs falling to Rs 2.70-2.76 per kWh.

This intense price competition saw over 50 new bidders enter the market. The sustainability of these low tariffs remains a concern, with IESA President Debmalya Sen noting, "All eyes will remain on whether the performance of these projects is in line with what was committed." Financing these projects, particularly those secured at low tariffs, presents the next major hurdle.

Key Projects and Government Support

March 2026 is set to witness the commissioning of Adani Green Energy Limited's 1,126 MW/3,530 MWh project in Gujarat, which is slated to be one of the world's largest single-location BESS installations. January will see Rajasthan tender its largest solar-plus-BESS project at Pugal Solar Park. Meanwhile, the commercial and industrial segment is showing rapid growth, underscored by Juniper Green Energy's 60 MWh merchant BESS installation in December.

Government support has been crucial for the sector's development. The second tranche of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) provided ₹5,400 crore to support 30 GWh of standalone BESS projects, alongside a mandate for 20% domestic value addition for VGF-backed projects. Further incentives include the extension of Interstate Transmission System (ISTS) charge waivers until 2028 for pumped storage and solar-plus-BESS projects.
