President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year’s address to a nation spanning 11 time zones on Wednesday, expressed confidence that Russia would continue to achieve its goals and move forward.



In the pre-recorded message, broadcast across the country just minutes before midnight in each time zone, Putin emphasized that Russia relies on its own strength and the unity of its people.



The address began in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, in Russia’s far east, facing Alaska across the Bering Strait.



“We rely on our own strength, on those close to us, and are always ready to lend a shoulder,” Putin said during the three-minute-and-20-second message.



Amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which Russia calls a “special military operation” launched on February 24, 2022, Putin highlighted that millions of Russians stand with the soldiers fighting for the Motherland.



"Millions across Russia are thinking of you, standing with you on this New Year’s Eve, united in our sincere, selfless, and devoted love for Russia,” he said.



Putin also remarked that the successes of the Russian people are writing new chapters in the country’s thousand-year history, and that unity is key to Russia’s sovereignty and security.



"May our traditions, faith, and memory unite all generations and support us always. Together, we are one big family, strong and united," he added.



Additionally, Putin declared 2026 as the Year of National Unity.
