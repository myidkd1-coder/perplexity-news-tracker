Union Budget 2026 Bets Big On Rare Earths, Chips & Orange Economy: Nirmala Sitharaman's Full Speech

The FM announced the launch of India Semiconductor Mission 2.0, giving impetus to building domestic capabilities in the semiconductor equipment, chemicals and gases market, estimated to be around $400 billion by 2030, according to India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA) and SEMI India, an industry body.This comes at a time of global supply bottlenecks due to increasing AI workloads. As capex and specific equipment are shifted towards high bandwidth memory and advanced DRAM for training and inference of AI, straining global original equipment makers (OEMs), experts say this presents a rare opportunity for India to build an ecosystem, both by encouraging global players to source more from Indian MSMEs and creating domestic champions in the longer-term.Raja Manickam, founder and chief executive of fabless startup iVP Semi and industry veteran, said in the initial stages, incentives should encourage global OEMS source more from India. "The demand for new wafer fabs is extremely high because of AI," he said.It could be the right time for India as the demand and lead times for chip equipment are longer, but only if AI demands hold up, says Sanjay Kumar, VP at AT-Kearney and former senior director, US department of commerce, CHIPS Program office."Indian internal consumption is not going to match major hubs like Taiwan and Korea, so production should target export markets, which only global OEMs are able to qualify for," he said.In 5-7 years, India can build competitive strength in low to mid complexity segments such as sub-fab equipment vacuum systems, automation systems for wafer handling, precision mechanics and advanced packaging equipment, says Ashok Chandak, president of IESA and SEMI India.
