At the 2026 Golden Globes, a surprise “Hamnet” win in motion picture drama set up an Oscar showdown with comedy/musical winner “One Battle After Another” — while a raft of cheap gimmicks weighed down the show. Times columnists Mary McNamara and Glenn Whipp discussed all the best and worst moments as they happened in our Globes live chat. Read their full conversation below.

Winners list | Best red carpet looks | More Globes coverage

8:18 p.m. Three hours and 18 minutes by my count. Whew. —M.M.

Time for a few small beers, Mary. —G.W.

I couldn’t have done it without you, Glenn! And I’d like to thank our editor Matt Brennan and our producer the L.A. Times and my support staff, Koda and Harley, who have been piling their dog toys at my feet while wondering if I am ever going to move again. —M.M.

8:14 p.m. “Hamnet” wins for drama! Is that surprising to you, Glenn? —M.M.

Ooooooooh. “Hamnet”??? Not “Sinners”??? Boooooo. But yay for a surprise? —G.W.

This is what I meant about the curse of the spring movie. —M.M.

I think it’s more the curse of the Globes voters not getting a movie about life for Black Americans in the Jim Crow South. —G.W.

I did love “Hamnet,” though, and it’s tough to beat a movie that ends with such a visceral message about the power of theater. —M.M.

8:13 p.m. Am I the only one waiting for the entire cast of “Ocean’s Eleven” to arrive on stage as George Clooney and Don Cheadle present motion picture drama? —G.W.

Seriously. What a tease! Though any excuse for Cheadle. —M.M.

“Knock ‘em dead, Batman” was good though. —G.W.

8:10 p.m. “One Battle After Another” just won in musical/comedy. Which is also a tiny bit weird. But whatever. Also, Roberts gave a lovely shout-out to “Sorry, Baby,” which is a terrific movie too. —M.M.

“One Battle After Another” is a musical/comedy; “Sinners,” the movie centered on music (and vampires), is a drama. They’re both from Warner Bros. —G.W.

Wagner Moura (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

8:06 p.m. I just got an alert on my TV saying, “no action for 4 hours. Go into sleep mode?” —M.M.

I am searching my memory for a moment from this show that would have activated a viewer from sleep mode. Nothing is coming to mind. —G.W.

But, but Julia Roberts just arrived ... —M.M.

8:02 p.m. Moura wins for “Secret Agent,” while some viewers must be wondering if it is yet another adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel. (It is not). So are we looking at a Brazilian best picture Oscar winner? And will it have a wider release here? —M.M.

It will be nominated for international feature and could well earn a spot in the best picture field, Mary. Look for it in theaters in February as Neon will look to capitalize on those Oscar nominations. And I think Moura will earn a nod too. —G.W.

Jessie Buckley (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

7:58 p.m. Mary? Jessie Buckley just won! —G.W.

Predictable, perhaps, but worth it. Buckley is a phenomenal and highly elastic actor who is 100% the real deal, terrific in “Hamnet” but also “The Lost Daughter,” “Beast” and “Wicked Little Letters.” We should get used to her winning awards. And oh, that accent. —M.M.

I need soup right now. —G.W.

I am actually making chicken soup right now. I mean, I made it and now it is simmering. —M.M.

Simmering or shimmering? Or both? —G.W.

7:43 p.m. We’re about to get prizes for “Adolescence,” “The Studio,” Jessie Buckley, Wagner Moura, “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” —G.W.

You’re two for two, Glenn. Maybe you should just step away and go get us some In-N-Out. With all these awards, Season 2 of “The Studio” had better be good. —M.M.

The one category that’s competitive is lead actor in a motion picture drama. It’s between Moura and Michael B. Jordan. Moura needs it more. He didn’t get a nomination from SAG-AFTRA voters, who don’t reward international movies much. But I’d love to see Jordan win for playing the twins in “Sinners.” He created two vivid, distinct characters. —G.W.

I agree. I feel like “Sinners” is paying the price for being a spring movie; voters may have forgotten how freaking amazing it is. And Jordan was miraculous — as someone who has reviewed far too many titles with multiple characters played by one actor, it is very difficult to pull off without it feeling super-stuntish. Which he absolutely did, so extra points for level of difficulty. —M.M.

7:38 p.m. How are you doing, Glenn? Six more categories to go! —M.M.

What? Sorry, Mary. I was listening to a podcast during the commercial break. Interesting stuff. I might subscribe to one of these! —G.W.

I think someone should give us a podcast. Then we might finally win a Golden Globe. We could call it “Shakes Fist at Clouds.” —M.M.

Aren’t we doing this live on camera for the Oscars? You floated that at the Festival of Books last year. Or was that me? —G.W.

I would get bleeped too much I think. —M.M.

7:29 p.m. But now we’re back with “The Pitt” winning drama series, with commentators having a meltdown over Wyle embracing “ER” buddy George Clooney. (Yes, I rolled my eyes at their reaction.) Always good to see John Wells though. —M.M.

7:27 p.m. Wait. Rhea Seehorn won an award? She’s as surprised as I am! —G.W.

Yes! I asked for a surprise and this is the best one! And somewhere our TV critic Robert Lloyd is cheering loudly. As am I. Everyone needs to watch “Pluribus.” —M.M.

Wanda Sykes (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

7:17 p.m. “Bill Maher, you give us so much. But try a little less.” Wanda Sykes, national treasure. —M.M.

Wanda Sykes should host! —G.W.

“Kevin Hart is the richest guy in this category and yet I know he wants it the most,” Sykes says, presenting the stand-up performance award. “Ricky Gervais, I love you for not being here. Because if you win, I get to accept for you and you’re going to thank God and the trans community.” And Gervais wins, thanking God and the trans community. Honestly, that moment made the show worth it for me. Someone check Twitter for Ricky’s response. —M.M.

A great moment ... for a category that has no business being on this show. Stand-up specials, box office achievement, podcasts. Next year they’ll add AI achievement. —G.W.

OMG, Glenn! It’s the Golden Globes! Eat some kettle corn-flavored PopCorners and calm the heck down. I never thought I would be defending the Globes, but at least they’re not moving to YouTube. —M.M.

7:15 p.m. Erin Doherty for another “Adolescence” win. Personally, I will never forget her Princess Anne singing “Starman” in “The Crown.” One of TV’s best moments. —M.M.

“The Secret Agent” director Kleber Mendonça Filho accepts the award for non-English language film. (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

7:08 p.m. There’s the score announcement! Ludwig Göransson for “Sinners”! —G.W.

Wait, I blinked and missed score. But the “Secret Agent” win must make you a little happier. —M.M.

It makes Brazil happy! And they get very happy about these things! The one good thing that might come from this show. —G.W.

How are they the first people to get played off? —M.M.

Because they needed room for the podcast category. —G.W.

Dude, what have podcasts done to you? —M.M.

What was that, Mary? They played off “The Secret Agent” and immediately afterward, the UFC people came on stage? —G.W.

OK, OK, that was objectionable. But at least now I know who they are. —M.M.

So Kleber Mendonça Filho, writer-director of “The Secret Agent,” gets an abbreviated time on stage, starts to say something about the dangers of authoritarianism and gets played off ... for a UFC promo spot. I am actively hating this show now. —G.W.

You are hiding it well, Glenn. —M.M.

7:02 p.m. How many times have you seen “KPop Demon Hunters,” Mary? Or has your household aged out of that one? —G.W.

I am an empty-nester now, Glenn. So I will not be answering that question. —M.M.

You didn’t dip in just to see what the kids are on about? I watched through “Golden.” Then I was like, I get it. Also, by just about every metric, I am not the target audience. —G.W.

I think “grumpy guy shaking fist at clouds” is every film’s target audience. —M.M.

Paul Thomas Anderson (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:55 p.m. If you’re looking for some Oscar tea leaves Mary, PTA winning for writing and directing “One Battle After Another” is something. —G.W.

Well, I kind of feel like I knew that going in. Tell me something I do not already know Golden Globe voters! —M.M.

I presented best picture to Anderson last night at the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn. dinner and he got emotional when talking about Adam Somner, one of “One Battle’s” producers, a guy whose IMDb page looks like a greatest hits of 21st century cinema. —G.W.

I like his willingness to spread the credit to folks who don’t often get mentioned. He appears nice enough to almost deserve being married to Maya Rudolph. —M.M.

6:53 p.m. Judd Apatow with a callback to one of the great Golden Globes category placements — “The Martian” in comedy! —G.W.

I was just writing that Apatow is clearly reading our live chat! —M.M.

6:45 p.m. “Life is short, awards season is long.” This is going to be a three-hour show and I don’t feel we are any closer to knowing who the Oscar favorites are, which is supposed to be the whole point. Am I missing something, Glenn? —M.M.

No, Mary. Those awards are coming, though, again, they’re not as important as the guild honors from producers, directors and actors. —G.W.

The “Sinners” team. (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:39 p.m. How do you feel about cinematic and box office achievement? I’m glad “Sinners” won, but it’s in a category in which they were up against “Zootopia 2.” —M.M.

My patience with this show was at near-empty ... and now the bleeping box office category. I love “Sinners,” but what is the purpose of this category? “Sinners” might have had the lowest box office of all the nominees. It has made less than a fifth of “Zootopia 2.” Just another bogus category to generate ad sales for the show’s corporate owner. —G.W.

6:36 p.m. Michelle Williams wins for “Dying for Sex,” which is only right. —M.M.

Oh my God. Sarah Snook was right there! —G.W.

Stephen Graham (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:34 p.m. Stephen Graham wins for “Adolescence,” which is boring in a “Are we back at the Emmys?” way but I do love him so much. As a fan of British TV, I’ve seen him in loads of things and he brings so much to even the smallest part. —M.M.

Again, back in the day, this would have gone to Matthew Rhys in “The Beast in Me” and not the guy from the show that won a million Emmys four months ago. —G.W.

A Rhys win would have been great, especially if he gave his acceptance speech in Welsh. —M.M.

I love Stephen Graham too! Just would like one award that’s not a rubber-stamp! —G.W.

Timothée Chalamet. (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:25 p.m. Oh look, Chalamet won — another big “surprise.” —M.M.

Timothéeeeeeeeeeee! —G.W.

Could something amazing or unpredictable please happen soon? Like you, Glenn, I do not feel nostalgia for the old Globes but this all feels so... careful. Or maybe “calculated” is a better word. —M.M.

“Will he thank Kylie Jenner?” the announcer breathlessly asked as Chalamet walked to the stage. He didn’t, at least not by name! Wonder what Polymarket said about that one. This is so cheap. —G.W.

Chalamet did thank “my partner,” which honestly is grounds for a breakup. Say my name! —M.M.

It’s just short of “business associate.” —G.W.

Rose Byrne (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:21 p.m. Rose Byrne wins for “If I Had Legs I‘d Kick You,” which I guess was a musical or a comedy? Felt like a documentary to me. —M.M.

“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You” in comedy is funny ... funnier than anything in this harrowing movie. Utterly bizarre category placement. —G.W.

I am actually quite concerned that a movie about a beleaguered working mother with no support literally losing her mind is considered a comedy. —M.M.

“If I Had Legs” is suffocating, harrowing. Might be the most difficult watch of 2025. Rose Byrne is great, but allowing that movie to be placed in musical/comedy so that she wouldn’t have to compete against Jessie Buckley is sooooo Globes. —G.W.

6:18 p.m. Paul Thomas Anderson wins for screenplay for “One Battle After Another.” Not a surprise. —M.M.

Paul Thomas Anderson winning screenplay — a category the Globes don’t divide between adapted and original like the Oscars — is a nice little bounce for “One Battle After Another.” It could have easily gone to Ryan Coogler for “Sinners.” Those are the two movies that will win at the Academy Awards. —G.W.

It is difficult to see “Sinners” not win. —M.M.

6:07 p.m. An hour in and we are only a third of the way through the categories. Just sayin’. —M.M.

Here’s a sign of the apocalypse ... they showed clips of the podcast nominees, which, yes, were just shots of people talking in a studio, but did not show clips of the supporting actor movie nominees. Apocalypse? OK, maybe I’m being dramatic, but oooof. That’s where we’re at in 2026. —G.W.

Ejae accepts the award for original song. (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

6:03 p.m. Simmer down. “KPop Demon Hunters” just won for best original song, “Golden.” I know you were hoping for that. —M.M.

Haha ... I’m not a hater. Though this original song presentation reminds me that I believe they have moved the original score category off the telecast ... probably so we could get that podcast prize in. —G.W.

Amy Poehler and Snoop Dogg. (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

5:52 p.m. All this Polymarket shilling is gross. The show, these announcers doing corny play by play ... it’s hard to watch. Feels low-rent. And it’s waaaaaaaaaaay too late for Nicole Kidman AMC parody. —G.W.

Aw come on, the podcast satire is funny. “Podcasts: They’re just what we have now.” And one of them is about to win a Golden Globe. Honestly, a cultural statement that we need but perhaps do not want. Though I will never object to Amy Poehler winning any award. —M.M.

Tepid applause for Snoop’s endorsement of the podcast category inclusion. I’m sitting on my hands too. Thank you, Spotify! Thank you for paying artists next to nothing! Thank you for those ICE recruitment ads! Thank you for promoting AI musicians! THANK YOU! —G.W.

“Mom and Dad you can watch the Patriots now.” I am a mom, you are a dad. Can we? —M.M.

I would like to watch the Chargers play the Patriots, Mary. Don’t tempt me to multi-screen! —G.W.

5:45 p.m. “I’m Zoe Kravitz and I have my own ‘shrooms.” Best line of the night? —M.M.

These TV awards choices are so dull that I need my own ‘shrooms. —G.W.

Yeah, it’s Emmys 2.0. Martin Short did not look pleased when Seth Rogen said he “grew up” admiring and hoping he would beat him. —M.M.

Jean Smart (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

5:40 p.m. Back in the day, the Globes loved to plant a flag for new shows in the TV categories, rewarding work ahead of the Emmys. Now, it’s just a repeat of the Emmys. Smart, Wyle ... look for “The Studio,” “The Pitt” and “Adolescence” to win later on. You know the drill. —G.W.

5:34 p.m. Watching Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett banter, I can’t help but wish we were watching “Smartless: On the Road” instead of this. But then Jean Smart wins for “Hacks” and I too am thrilled to be here. —M.M.

Why not rant during the ceremony, Jean Smart? The ceremony needs a good rant or two! —G.W.

God, she looks fabulous. Referencing her quasi-political red carpet rant: “I think everyone knows in their heart what the right thing is, so let’s do the right thing.” —M.M.

Noah Wyle (Rich Polk / Penske Media via Getty Images)

5:31 p.m. Once again I must watch Noah Wyle beat Gary Oldman for lead actor in a TV series (drama). Don’t get me wrong — I love Wyle and “The Pitt” and will be watching Season 2 screeners once this show is done. But it ain’t “Slow Horses.” —M.M.

I enjoy watching Oldman eating bad food too! But Wyle deserves this one. —G.W.

We will agree to disagree. —M.M.

Stellan Skarsgård. (Kevork Djansezian / CBS)

5:21 p.m. Man, they made Stellan Skarsgård walk a long way to pick up that trophy for supporting actor in a motion picture for “Sentimental Value.” —G.W.

“I was not prepared for this because I thought I was too old,” he says. He is such a great actor and so amazing in that film. Also he thanked his wife first, which is the No. 1 lesson of any awards show. —M.M.

“Cinema should be seen in cinemas.” Preach. —G.W.

OK, well, I saw it on streaming and it was still pretty good. —M.M.

Haha ... let’s not tell Skarsgård. That supporting actor race is an interesting one too, what with the two “One Battle After Another” actors — Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro — in contention. “Sentimental Value” didn’t do well with the guilds, but I think Oscar voters, a much more global group, will come through for it. Hope so. It’s a terrific movie. —G.W.

Teyana Taylor (Michael Buckner / Penske Media via Getty Images)

5:16 p.m. First award, for supporting actress in a motion picture, goes to Teyana Taylor, beginning the “One Battle After Another” sweep. Love that she wrote her speech on paper! Hate when folks read from their phones. —M.M.

First a caveat: These awards mean nothing in relation to the Oscars. But seeing the winners onstage delivering a big emotional speech, like the one Teyana Taylor just gave ... that means a little something. The supporting actress category comes into focus a bit more with this win too. I had Taylor in front of Amy Madigan for “Weapons.” I think Taylor will win. She anchors “One Battle After Another” in its first 40 minutes. —G.W.

Love when winners get this emotional and talk about the journey; it’s a good reminder that making art, and making it to any awards season, is a lot of work. —M.M.

Nikki Glaser (Kevork Djansezian / CBS)

5:14 p.m. Glaser’s monologue: What grade would you give it, Mary? Solid. I laughed a couple of times. Savaged CBS News. That’s worth half a letter. I’ll give it a B. —G.W.

C+. —M.M.

5:13 p.m. “Timothée Chalamet is the first actor who had to put on muscle for a movie about ping-pong.” Now I’m Team Nikki too. —M.M.

5:08 p.m. A Golden Globes tradition ... poking fun at the age of Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriends. But she isn’t wrong about, like, that’s the only thing we know about him. That and he vapes. I also love that Sean Penn is laughing along. And that he didn’t comb his hair. —G.W.

Oh he combed his hair. That level of dishevelment takes hours to achieve. But it looks pretty great, tbh. —M.M.

Really? Hours? Goals, Mary. Goals. —G.W.

5:04 p.m. “CBS News, America’s newest place to see BS news” — host Nikki Glaser takes aim close to home. —M.M.

Yes, the CBS news joke puts me on Team Nikki. —G.W.

5 p.m. Hello Mary! It’s time again to hunker down in front of the screen and banter about an awards show, in this case the 2026 Golden Globes, a for-profit, corporate cash grab whose ethics are even worse than when we investigated the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. five years ago. Do I long for the good old days when the nutty HFPA took lavish junkets and made spectacularly weird awards choices? Eh. I’m not going to be one of those people who looks back fondly on dubious things — like, say, the presidency of George W. Bush — and romanticizes them just because the present day is so repellent. Besides … we’ve got a long night ahead of us. In the words of the late great Marty DiBergi: Enough of my yakking. Let’s boogie! —G.W.

Glenn, my old building and loan, awards show buddy! I got my diet Mountain Dew, I got my Kettle Corn-flavored PopCorners and unsalted cashews (for protein) so bring on that boogie! Sure, I’m torn between admiration and despair that this ethically challenged awards show continues to thrive, but I’m choosing to see this night as a sign that, despite the lamentations of the doomsayers, Hollywood is alive and well and happy to go through the rigors of the red carpet to (mostly) lose a bunch of awards. Because it’s an honor to be nominated, amiright? And the fact that almost 10 million people tuned in for the last two shows (and millions more for the carved up clips on social media) proves that interest in film and television (also podcasts) remains high. Are you rooting for anyone in particular (JessieBuckleyJessieBuckleyJessieBuckley)? —M.M.

You’ll be happy on that front, Mary, as Buckley is one of the evening’s — and season’s — surest things. Me, I’m hoping for a repeat of last year when a Brazilian actor won a prize, catapulting them to an Oscar nomination. Will Wagner Moura (“The Secret Agent”) follow the path of Fernanda Torres (“I’m Still Here”)? We’ll soon see. —G.W.

More important, will “Slow Horses” win a bunch of well-deserved awards? —M.M.

Against “The Pitt”? Nah. —G.W.
