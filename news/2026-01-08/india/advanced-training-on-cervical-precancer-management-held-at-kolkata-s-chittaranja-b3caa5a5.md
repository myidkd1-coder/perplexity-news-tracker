Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the Lalla Salma Foundation for Cancer Prevention and Treatment (Rabat, Morocco), and the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI; Kolkata, India) conducted a new edition of an advanced training course on colposcopy and the management of cervical precancerous lesions, on 18–21 December 2025. The training took place at the CNCI Hospital in Kolkata.

This session brought together 11 general practitioners from Morocco’s private health-care sector, who strengthened their theoretical understanding and practical competencies in cervical cancer screening and early diagnosis. Through interactive sessions, clinical demonstrations, and supervised hands-on practice, the participants enhanced their ability to identify and manage cervical precancers.

By renewing this collaboration, IARC and its partners reaffirm their commitment to supporting countries in building skilled health workforces and implementing high-quality cervical cancer prevention programmes. These efforts contribute to accelerating progress towards global targets for cervical cancer elimination.
