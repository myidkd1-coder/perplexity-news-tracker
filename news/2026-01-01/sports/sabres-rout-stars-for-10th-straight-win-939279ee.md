Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 26-17 16-7 6-1 (Jan. 2)

16. Canada-U.S. showdown 🥇

Barring a major upset, we'll see a seventh gold-medal clash in Olympic women's hockey between rivals Canada and the United States in Milan. The U.S. embraced youth following its 2022 defeat, and it's paying dividends with an active six-game win streak against Canada.

American icon Hilary Knight is concluding her Olympic career, while Canada aims to eke out one more title from its veteran core. This matchup has produced some of the most dramatic Olympic moments of the past 16 years, and Milan is shaping up to be no different. - Kyle Cushman

15. New F1 regulations 🏁

There's a new era in Formula 1, and it goes beyond just a new drivers' champion in Lando Norris. We're talking new cars, new teams, and new regulations. The 2026 season brings the biggest set of changes to the grid in over a decade, as the teams will debut cars that are smaller and lighter and feature active aerodynamics. Plus, the power units are set to feature more emphasis on electric power.

And for the first time since 2016, 11 teams will be on the grid with newcomers Audi and Cadillac joining the mix. It's going to be an arms race, and there's no telling who will emerge as the dominant force. - Daniel Valente

14. Joshua-Fury finally on tap? 🥊

Anthony Joshua could have a massive year ahead of him after scoring a sixth-round knockout of Jake Paul on Dec. 19. A long-awaited fight against former WBC heavyweight champion Tyson Fury is reportedly in the works for 2026.

Joshua and Fury have been linked for years as two of the top heavyweights of this generation. They came close to fighting in 2021, but it fell through because Fury had a contractual obligation to face Deontay Wilder instead. Will Fury and Joshua finally square off in 2026, or will this go down as one of the biggest matchups to never happen? - Nick Baldwin

13. Sid's next move 🐧

Sidney Crosby will be eligible for another contract extension as of July 1, and the noise around his future will be significant - again. How much more does he have in the tank? Does he want to end his career with the Penguins, or does he manufacture a trade to a contender?

Will 2026-27 be the final chapter of one of the most storied NHL careers we've ever seen? Crosby, who's notorious for keeping to himself, will have to address his future at some point. The hockey world will be watching closely. - Sean O'Leary

12. Boozer vs. Dybantsa vs. Peterson 🔥

The 2025-26 college hoops campaign may ultimately be defined by a talented group of freshmen. AJ Dybantsa, the No. 1 overall recruit in the 2025 class, is spearheading BYU's high-octane attack with his elite finishing at the rim, shot-creation, and playmaking.

Duke's Cameron Boozer, who leads the nation in scoring, is looking to become the second straight Blue Devils player to capture the Wooden Award. Darryn Peterson, meanwhile, is a transformative two-way talent who could raise Kansas' ceiling immensely if he can get healthy. Arizona's Koa Peat and Houston's Kingston Flemings are starring for a pair of national contenders, too. March Madness can't come soon enough. - Chicco Nacion

11. Vonn, Kim chasing history 👀

Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn are synonymous with American excellence at the Winter Games, and both have a chance to make (more) history in 2026. Kim, who rocketed to superstardom by winning snowboard halfpipe gold as a 17-year-old in PyeongChang, defended her crown four years later in Beijing. Now 25, she'll look to stand on the top step of the podium for an unprecedented third consecutive time in the event, something no woman has achieved yet.

Vonn, meanwhile, is staging a remarkable renaissance at the other end of her career. The 41-year-old skiing icon returned to competition in 2024 after a five-year retirement brought on by injuries and several surgeries. She qualified for her fifth and final Olympics in the downhill discipline, and she's surging at the right time on the World Cup circuit. Vonn could become the oldest Olympic gold medalist, male or female, in alpine skiing. - Gianluca Nesci

10. CR7 eyeing 1,000 goals 🐐

The official Instagram for the late Pele claims he hit an unmatched 1,283 goals in his storied career. Romario insists he passed 1,000, too. But the Brazilian icons' figures include friendlies and probably even games against their kids in the back garden, while Cristiano Ronaldo's current sum of 957 only counts goals from competitive club matches and international fixtures. They're goals that matter.

It might seem a tough ask for Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, to reach 1,000 goals in 2026. But Portugal's upcoming friendlies and favorable World Cup draw, plus the fact that he plays in the Saudi Pro League, means one of the sport's all-time greats could actually do it. Ronaldo is "sure" he will at some point. Of course he is. - Daniel Rouse

9. Arch for Heisman? 🏆

All eyes will be on Arch Manning when Texas kicks off the 2026 season. The junior quarterback returns after a strong finish to the 2025 campaign, highlighted by clutch wins over Oklahoma and Texas A&M. If the Longhorns fortify their offensive line and welcome new weapons in the offseason, Manning should lead a hungry squad on a playoff push.

He'll share the spotlight with a loaded QB class featuring Julian Sayin and Gunner Stockton, but Manning's poise and arm talent could set him apart and position him as the top draft pick in 2027. - Matthew Washington

8. Can anyone stop Dodgers? 3️⃣

The Los Angeles Dodgers can become the first team since the New York Yankees (1998-2000) to win three straight World Series titles. L.A. came within two outs - and then an inch or two away - of losing the 2025 Fall Classic. So, the club is potentially beatable if it collectively hits .203 with a .658 OPS on the biggest stage once again.

However, this notion is scary as well because the Dodgers played badly and still won. They've shored up their bullpen with All-Star closer Edwin Díaz and could easily make another big splash this winter. Maybe money does buy happiness? - Tom Ruminski

7. OKC's pursuit of 74 wins ⚡️

The 28-5 Thunder have to be almost perfect the rest of the way to unseat the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors' single-season record of 73 wins. However, that's far from an impossible task for the defending champs. Their dominance has allowed them to limit Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to just 124.3 total fourth-quarter minutes - remarkably light work when you realize that over 75 players have already racked up over 200.

Victor Wembanyama's Spurs appear to be the only team capable of derailing what could be another special season in OKC. Even if the Thunder fall short of 74 wins, having the reigning MVP fresh for the playoffs would be an exceptional consolation prize as they chase another title. - Jonathan Soveta

Our series wraps Friday with the top six.
