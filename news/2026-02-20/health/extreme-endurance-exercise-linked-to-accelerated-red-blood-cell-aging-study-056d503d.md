Extreme Endurance Exercise Linked to Accelerated Red Blood Cell Aging: Study

A new study published in Blood Red Cells & Iron, a journal of the American Society of Hematology, suggests that extreme endurance running may damage red blood cells in ways that affect their normal function.

Researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus analyzed blood samples from 23 athletes who participated in two major races: the 40-kilometer Martigny-Combes à Chamonix race and the 171-kilometer Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc. Blood was collected immediately before and after the races to examine changes in thousands of proteins, lipids, metabolites, and trace elements.

The findings showed that red blood cells became less flexible after both races, particularly the longer ultramarathon. Since red blood cells must bend and squeeze through tiny blood vessels to deliver oxygen and remove waste, reduced flexibility could impair their efficiency. The study found evidence of both mechanical damage — caused by changes in blood flow and pressure during prolonged running — and molecular damage linked to inflammation and oxidative stress.

The researchers observed that these changes resembled accelerated aging of red blood cells and were more pronounced after the 171-kilometer race. This suggests that as race distance increases, red blood cell damage may intensify, potentially increasing the risk of anemia.

While the long-term consequences remain unclear, the authors caution that extreme endurance exercise may place sustained stress on the body’s most abundant cells. However, they do not advise against participation, noting that more research is needed.

Future studies aim to better understand recovery timelines and explore how these findings might improve athlete recovery strategies and even blood storage practices in transfusion medicine.

Exercise Combined with Protein Drinks Enhances Function in Dementia Patients, Study Finds

A simple daily routine—standing exercises paired with protein-rich nutritional drinks—may help people with dementia regain a degree of independence. In a new study from Karolinska Institutet, researchers found that beyond improving physical strength, the program was linked to participants needing less assistance with everyday tasks after three months. The findings were published in Alzheimer's & Dementia.

Dementia is often accompanied by muscle weakness, poor nutrition, and frailty—especially among older adults living in nursing homes. These factors can gradually reduce a person’s ability to manage daily activities such as dressing, hygiene, and mobility. The research team wanted to examine whether improving physical health could also reduce dependence on care.

The study included 102 residents from eight nursing homes in the Stockholm area. Over a 12-week period, participants in the intervention group performed simple standing exercises several times a day and consumed one to two protein-enriched nutritional drinks daily. A control group continued with standard care. Researchers monitored physical performance and carefully recorded how much assistance each resident required for routine tasks. The analysis was conducted retrospectively as part of the broader OPEN study.

When all participants were analyzed together, the overall differences between groups were modest. However, a more detailed breakdown revealed a striking pattern. Among residents in dementia-specific wards, those who followed the exercise and nutrition program showed meaningful functional improvements.

One possible explanation is that residents in dementia units had sufficient baseline physical capacity to benefit from structured movement and improved nutrition. Strengthening muscles and enhancing nutritional status may have enabled them to carry out more daily activities independently.

The researchers caution that the findings are based on secondary analyses and should be interpreted carefully. They recommend future trials where care time is a primary outcome and where staffing and organizational factors are closely examined. Still, the study highlights how relatively simple, low-cost interventions could meaningfully improve quality of life for people living with dementia.

Breakthrough CRISPR Tool Could Help Combat Antibiotic Resistance Crisis

What if we could make antibiotic resistance disappear—not just slow it down, but actively erase it from bacterial populations? Scientists at the University of California San Diego have developed a powerful new CRISPR-based tool designed to do exactly that: spread through bacterial communities and delete the genes that make them resistant to antibiotics.

The findings were published in the journal npj Antimicrobials and Resistance.

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is now one of the most urgent global health threats. Drug-resistant “superbugs” are rising in hospitals, farms, wastewater plants, and aquaculture systems. Some projections estimate that by 2050, resistant infections could cause over 10 million deaths annually. Instead of creating new antibiotics, researchers are now exploring ways to genetically re-sensitize bacteria to the drugs we already have.

Led by Professors Ethan Bier and Justin Meyer, the team engineered a second-generation Pro-Active Genetics system called pPro-MobV. Inspired by gene drives—tools previously used in insects to spread specific traits through populations—the system applies similar “gene-drive thinking” to bacteria.

Methodologically, the researchers designed a mobile genetic cassette built on CRISPR technology. This cassette specifically targets antibiotic resistance genes located on plasmids—small circular DNA molecules that replicate independently within bacterial cells. Once inserted, the cassette disrupts these resistance genes, restoring bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics. The updated pPro-MobV system spreads between bacteria through conjugal transfer, a process similar to bacterial mating, allowing the CRISPR components to move efficiently from one cell to another.

Importantly, the team demonstrated that the system functions within biofilms—dense microbial communities that are notoriously difficult to treat and are responsible for many chronic infections. The researchers also showed that bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) can help transport elements of the system, potentially enhancing its reach.

As a built-in safety measure, the platform includes a homology-based deletion mechanism, allowing removal of the genetic cassette if needed. Together, these findings suggest a promising new strategy—not merely to contain antibiotic resistance, but to actively reverse it across bacterial populations in clinical and environmental settings.
