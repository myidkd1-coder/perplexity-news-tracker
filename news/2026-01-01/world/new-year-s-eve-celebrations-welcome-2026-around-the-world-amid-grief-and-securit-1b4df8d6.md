Around the world, 2026 has begun to arrive. Crowds across the globe have gathered to ring in the new year, often accompanied by increased security measures.

In some communities, the traditional celebrations were shadowed by grief. Hong Kong adjusted its plans in honor of the 161 people who recently died in a high-rise apartment fire, while public events in Sydney, Australia, paid tribute to the 15 people killed in a terror attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Dec. 14.

Here's how the world is ringing in 2026, in photos.

The celebrations to ring in the new year began with a bang in the Americas.

In Brazil, revelers packed the iconic Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro for concerts and a 12-minute fireworks show. On Dec. 30, the Brazilian city received the title of the world's largest New Year's Eve celebration from the Guinness World Records, a recognition of its famous massive festivity with live music shows by the sea.

After midnight, the ball will rise again, sparkling in red, white and blue to mark the United States' upcoming 250th birthday.

Increased security for New Year's Eve in Europe



A few hours before midnight arrived in Europe, Pope Leo XIV gave his final general audience of 2025 in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. He quoted the late Pope Francis, led the congregation in a traditional prayer, and looked back upon the events of 2025.

In Paris, a New Year's Eve concert was cancelled because officials feared "unpredictable crowd movements" on the Champs-Elysées, which had been "deemed to not be sized" appropriately for the event. The new year is being celebrated with fireworks and a video projection on the Arc de Triomphe.

London is hosting a ticketed fireworks event in the middle of the city, but Primrose Hill, a popular viewpoint, will be inaccessible, the Metropolitan Police Department said. Law enforcement has been deployed across the city to "provide a reassuring presence, to deter those who might want to take advantage of the crowds to commit crime and to respond decisively to any incidents," said MPD Commander Nick John, who is in charge of the New Year's Eve policing operation. Security was also increased on public transportation.

Ukraine is marking its fourth New Year's at war following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

In his end-of-the-year address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country is close to a peace deal with Russia, but cautioned that the most important issues were still unsolved and that any agreement should not reward Moscow.

"The peace agreement is 90 percent ready. Ten percent remains. And that is far more than just numbers," Zelenskyy said in the address, posted on his Telegram account. "Those are the 10 percent that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe."

Russian President Vladimir Putin used his traditional New Year's address to reaffirm his belief in Russia's eventual success in its invasion of Ukraine. He praised Russian troops as heroes, "fighting for your native land, truth and justice."

"We believe in you and our victory," Putin said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.

In Greece and Cyprus, officials turned down the volume, replacing some traditional fireworks with low-noise pyrotechnics, light shows and drone displays in capital cities. Officials said the change is intended to make celebrations more welcoming for children and pets, particularly animals sensitive to loud noise.

Solemnity and celebration mix in Australia and New Zealand

Countries in the South Pacific were first to ring in the new year, as midnight struck in New Zealand a full 18 hours before the ball was scheduled to drop in New York City's Times Square.

In Auckland, New Zealanders welcomed 2026 with a fireworks display launched from the country's tallest structure, Sky Tower, in a celebration that drew thousands despite rain. The five-minute pyrotechnic display involved 3,500 fireworks launched from various floors of the 787-foot tower. Smaller community events were canceled across New Zealand's North Island on Wednesday due to dismal weather forecasts.

Australia's east coast welcomed 2026 just two hours later, but in Sydney, the country's largest city, celebrations were held under the pall of Australia's worst mass shooting in almost 30 years. Two gunmen targeted a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach on Dec. 14, killing 15 people in what authorities called an ISIS-inspired antisemitic terror attack.

Officials had said that more than 2,500 officers would be on hand to patrol the area around Sydney's iconic harbor, the epicenter of New Year's Eve celebrations. Many were to openly carry automatic rifles, a sight rarely seen in Sydney.

Amid those security measures, thousands thronged to the waterfront to watch a fireworks show centered on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.

New South Wales Premier Chris Minns had urged Sydney residents not to stay away due to fear, saying extremists would interpret smaller crowds at New Year's Eve festivities as a victory.

"We can't be in a situation where this horrible, criminal, terrorist event changes the way we live in our beautiful city," Minns told reporters on Wednesday. "We have to show defiance in the face of this terrible crime and say that we're not going to be cowered by this kind of terrorism."

An hour before midnight, the Bondi Beach massacre victims were commemorated with one minute of silence, while images of a menorah were projected onto the bridge's pylons. The crowd was invited to show solidarity with Australia's Jewish community by shining their phone lights across the harbor.

Observances across Asia

In Indonesia, one of Australia's nearest neighbors, cities scaled back New Year's Eve festivities as a gesture of solidarity with communities devastated by catastrophic floods and landslides that struck parts of Sumatra island a month ago, claiming more than 1,100 lives.

The capital, Jakarta, chose to reduce the usual fanfare, opting instead for subdued celebrations with a calm and reflective program centered on prayers for victims, city Gov. Pramono Anung said last week. But a large crowd still gathered to welcome 2026.

Concerts and fireworks on Indonesia's tourist island of Bali have been canceled and replaced with a cultural arts event featuring 65 groups performing traditional dances.

Hong Kong, too, was to ring in 2026 without the usual spectacular and colorful explosions in the sky over its iconic Victoria Harbor, after a massive fire tore through an apartment complex in November and killed at least 161 people.

The city's tourism board instead hosted a music show featuring soft rock duo Air Supply and other singers in Central, a business district. The facades of eight landmarks were to turn into giant countdown clocks presenting a three-minute light show at midnight.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, in a New Year's Eve address broadcast by state media, hailed his country's technological progress in areas such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors while renewing threats against Taiwan, which it claims as part of its sovereign territory.

"We Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share a bond of blood and kinship," he said.

"The reunification of our motherland, a trend of the times, is unstoppable," Xi said, as his country's military announced the conclusion of large-scale military drills around Taiwan that were condemned by the democratically governed island's leadership as "highly provocative and reckless."
