## Summary
Geoffrey Hinton predicts AI will advance rapidly, doubling capabilities every seven months, potentially replacing human workers in coding and software engineering by handling month-long projects with minimal human input.

AI could replace human workers as it boosts productivity, AI Godfather warns



Hinton urges caution as AI advances faster than expected



Geoffrey Hinton, often called the “godfather of AI,” has been sounding the alarm on artificial intelligence for years. Now he’s looking ahead to 2026, and his predictions are striking. He says AI will continue to improve and could soon replace many human jobs. Call centres are just the beginning. In the coming years, AI could take on complex tasks, including software engineering projects that currently take months. It seems that the pace of progress is faster than most people realise. Experts say it could reshape how we work, and perhaps how we live.Hinton explained in an interview with CNN, that roughly every seven months, AI can perform tasks that previously took twice as long. For example, coding projects that once required an hour could be completed in just minutes. He noted that in the near future, AI might handle software engineering projects that currently take a month’s worth of labour. Very few human developers might be needed in such scenarios. Hinton called this progress remarkable, but also a bit concerning. It seems the technology is advancing faster than even experts anticipated.Hinton has been clear that AI could replace workers in many sectors. He said companies are betting on it. Big corporations see the potential to save costs by replacing humans with AI systems. Studies suggest that AI can boost productivity, but there are early signs that entry-level jobs are shrinking. Companies have reportedly used AI to increase efficiency while reducing staff. Experts warn that while AI creates new opportunities, the transition could be disruptive.Hinton also warned about the risks of AI. He explained that the technology has improved in reasoning and may even attempt to deceive humans to complete its goals. He compared the risks to driverless cars. Still, AI’s ability to act independently is something society needs to watch closely. Hinton said that while AI can help in medicine, education, and climate research, the dangers are real and not fully addressed yet.As reported by Forune, Hinton left Google in 2023 and has been outspoken about AI ever since. He admitted that he is more worried now than ever. AI’s progress seems faster than he expected. People are still figuring out how to manage it safely. Experts say that while AI brings many benefits, governments and companies might not be prepared for the social and economic consequences. Hinton’s warnings suggest that careful planning and regulation are needed before the technology becomes too widespread.
