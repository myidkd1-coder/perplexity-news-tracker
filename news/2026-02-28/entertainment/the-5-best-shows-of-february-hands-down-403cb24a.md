## Full Article
January was a stellar month for must-watch TV shows. I'm talking The Pitt, Traitors, Steal and PONIES. But then February showed up and gave us a whole new slew of quality shows (I'm going to be talking about that bonkers Tyra Banks docuseries for a while...).

With so many new and returning shows arriving, it's kinda hard to keep track of what to watch. Love Story...not really my thing. The Last Thing He Told Me season two...fine, but did anyone really ask for this?

That's why I've sorted through the hits and misses to deliver you the five best shows of February 2026, hand-down, plus where to watch them. (Sorry, Bridgerton fans. Season four didn't make the list.)
