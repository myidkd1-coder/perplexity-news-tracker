Wings India 2026 will open with a rare sight on an Indian flight line: a complete civil airliner programme carrying the imprint of domestic manufacturing ambition.

Hindustan Aeronautics Limited’s SuperJet SJ-100, including its Aurus business jet variant, makes its formal debut alongside the H-228 commuter aircraft, signalling India’s most serious return to civil aircraft production since the Avro era.

For a country that has spent decades as one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, but not a producer of commercial aircraft, the message from Hyderabad’s Begumpet Airport is unambiguous.

Wings India 2026 is no longer just about aircraft arriving in India. It is about aircraft being built here.

HAL brings civil aviation back to centre stage at Wings India 2026

HAL’s presence at Wings India 2026 goes beyond symbolism. The company will showcase a full civil portfolio spanning regional fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and future-ready platforms, anchored by the SJ-100, the H-228 commuter aircraft and the Dhruv New Generation helicopter.

The SJ-100’s appearance is particularly significant. Developed by Yakovlev under Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation and now undergoing full localisation as part of India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, the twin-engine regional jet is designed to carry up to 103 passengers over routes of around 3,500 km.

With fly-by-wire controls, CAT IIIA autoland capability and PD-8 engines, the aircraft is positioned as a practical regional workhorse rather than a prestige platform.

For HAL, the programme marks the first time in more than three decades that a complete passenger aircraft is being positioned for domestic production, following the conclusion of the Avro HS-748 programme in the late 1980s.

Industry observers see the SJ-100 as a test case for whether India can translate its deep defence aerospace experience into a sustainable civil manufacturing ecosystem.

Dr D K Sunil, CMD, HAL, said, “HAL is steadily expanding its civil aviation footprint and the showcase of Dhruv NG, H-228 and the SJ-100 trinity at Wings India reflects our focused thrust in strengthening regional connectivity, civil utility operations and future-ready aircraft programmes, while reinforcing India’s journey towards self-reliance in civil aviation.”

Alongside the standard SJ-100, HAL will also display the SJ-100 Aurus business jet variant, underlining ambitions to address not only regional airline demand, but also the growing corporate and government aviation market.

HAL’s H-228 targets regional connectivity under India’s UDAN scheme

If the SJ-100 represents India’s re-entry into jet manufacturing, the H-228 reflects the operational realities of regional air travel.

Derived from the Dornier lineage but progressively adapted for Indian conditions, the H-228 is designed to operate from short and semi-prepared runways, making it well suited to India’s UDAN regional connectivity scheme.

Both land and amphibious variants will be on display, highlighting potential applications ranging from island connectivity to coastal surveillance and utility operations.

HAL plans customer demonstration flights of the H-228 during the show, a move expected to attract interest from state governments, charter operators and regional airlines assessing aircraft capable of serving remote and underserved routes.

HAL showcases indigenous helicopters and civil MRO ambitions

Completing HAL’s civil line-up will be the Dhruv New Generation helicopter and the LUH Civil variant. Together, they reinforce HAL’s push beyond platform sales into lifecycle support, accessories, components and MRO services.

Digital kiosks at the HAL pavilion will showcase line-replaceable units, accessories and maintenance offerings, signalling a broader ambition to anchor long-term civil aviation support within India rather than relying on overseas supply chains.

Global OEMs, including Airbus and Embraer, bring next-gen aircraft to Wings India 2026

While indigenous platforms will dominate early attention, Wings India 2026 will also host a strong international presence.

Embraer will display its E195-E2 and E175 aircraft, positioning the Brazilian manufacturer squarely within India’s regional growth narrative.

The E195-E2, billed as the quietest and most fuel-efficient aircraft in its class, targets the sub-150-seat segment that analysts expect could account for at least 500 aircraft in India over the next two decades. The E175, already operated by Star Air, will underline Embraer’s established footprint in the country.

Airbus is expected to field a broad portfolio, including the A321neo, A220, H160 helicopter and the H125, which is slated for assembly in India.

The European manufacturer will also highlight simulation and services offerings, reflecting its long-term commitment to India’s aviation ecosystem.

Indian airlines showcase new aircraft at Wings India 2026

Indian carriers are also set to use Wings India 2026 as a platform to underline fleet transformation.

Air India will unveil its new Boeing 787-9 ahead of its commercial entry into service in early February, while Air India Express is expected to showcase its first line-fit Boeing 737-8 aircraft.

IndiGo has brought along its Airbus A321 freighter from its subsidiary IndiGo CarGo, but did not showcase its first Airbus A321XLR. That’s not surprising given it’s only just launched service to Greece with the type.

Air displays and the wider aviation ecosystem at Wings India 2026

Beyond the static ramp, Wings India 2026 will feature flying displays and aerobatics, with the Indian Air Force’s Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team headlining the aerial programme. Helicopters, training aircraft and civil platforms will feature prominently, reflecting aviation’s expanding role beyond scheduled airline operations.

The exhibition will be supported by a high-level international conference programme covering airports, aircraft leasing, MRO, air cargo, sustainable aviation fuel, advanced air mobility and drones.

An aviation job fair, student innovation challenge and awards ceremony will further broaden the event’s appeal.

With official delegations from more than 20 countries and strong participation from Indian states, Wings India 2026 is shaping up as more than a trade show; it is a statement of intent.
