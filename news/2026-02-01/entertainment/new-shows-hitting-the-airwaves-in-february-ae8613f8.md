With January coming to a close, February is right around the corner, bringing new shows to our screens. While there aren’t many big-name releases, there certainly isn’t a lack of content. Here are five shows releasing this February that I found interesting.

The Muppet Show – Feb 4

“The Muppet Show” is returning for its 50th anniversary with a special event episode on February first. The original show ran from 1976 to 1981, and during its run, it earned numerous awards. This new special is described as a variety show at the Muppet Theatre that Kermit the Frog, Ms. Piggy, and all the muppets are returning to produce. Special Guest stars Sabrina Carpenter, Maya Rudolph, and Seth Rogen will be featured. All five seasons of the original “The Muppet Show” are currently available on Disney+, with the special arriving on ABC and Disney+ on Feb. 4.

The Burbs – Feb 8

“The Burbs” follows a newly married couple, played by Keke Palmer and Jack Whitehall, as they move to the husband’s childhood neighborhood, and old secrets resurface. “The Burbs” is an adaptation of the 1989 film of the same name, which received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Check it out when all eight episodes come to Peacock on Feb 8.

56 Days – Feb 18

If you are looking for a new crime thriller, look no further than “56 Days.” Based on Catherine Ryan Howard’s novel, the show will follow Oliver Kennedy and Ciara Wyse, played by Avan Jogia and Dove Cameron, respectively, as they fall in love after a meeting in a supermarket. After a body is found in Oliver’s apartment, their relationship is reexamined as the police try to find who did it. “56 Days” arrives on Prime Video on Feb. 18.

Survivor Season 50 – Feb 25

The reality TV show “Survivor” is back for its 25th anniversary and 50th season titled “Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans.” “Survivor” places contestants on isolated islands where they have to provide fire, food, and shelter for themselves. They compete in various challenges to win rewards like cooked meals and immunity from elimination. Players are progressively eliminated until about three are left, at which point the jury, made up of eliminated players, votes for the winner, the “Sole Survivor.” The winner receives a prize of $1,000,000.

Season 50 consists of the biggest cast yet, with a total of 24 players. All of these players are returning from previous seasons of the show. The season will also feature many celebrities, such as Billie Eilish, Zac Brow, Jimmy Fallon, and Jimmy Donaldson, otherwise known as Mr. Beast.

All of these and the certainly many surprises they are hiding are sure to make “Survivor 50” one of the biggest seasons yet. The season premieres on CBS on Feb. 25.

Monarch: Legacy of Monstars Season 2 – Feb 27

In the wait for the next Godzilla x Kong movie comes the second season of “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.” The series takes place after the “Godzilla” movie as members of the Monarch organization encounter Godzilla and other Titans. The primary actors are Wyatt and Kurt Russell, who both play the character of Lee Shaw, a younger version and an older version, respectively. “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” season two arrives on Apple TV on Feb. 27.

While I’m not sure I’m going to be able to fit these shows into my already packed TV show watch schedule, I hope you found at least one of them interesting and check it out yourself. Comment down below or message me on Instagram @zachfornalmedia with what shows you are watching this February.
