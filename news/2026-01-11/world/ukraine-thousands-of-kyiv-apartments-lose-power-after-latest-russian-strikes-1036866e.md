Ukraine: Thousands of Kyiv apartments lose power overnight amid more Russian strikes A staggering 6,000 apartments in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, are without heating after a massive new wave of Russian strikes across the country overnight into Friday. Hundreds of drones and dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles were used during the attacks, which left at least four dead, according to Ukrainian officials. They said that half of Kyiv’s apartments were impacted by the loss of heating, while water supplies across the city were disrupted too.

A hypersonic Oreshnik missile was also reportedly used to target Lviv in western Ukraine near the Polish border; it is the second time such a weapon has been launched since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Amid plummeting temperatures, Kyiv authorities reported that key services remain under pressure.

Residents impacted by the overnight strikes who have somewhere warm to go have been urged to leave the city temporarily.

Sudan: Tens of millions of civilians bear brunt of 1,000 days of war

Aid agencies marked 1,000 days of war in Sudan on Friday with a reminder that the conflict has created the world’s biggest hunger crisis and largest displacement emergency.

Every day, civilians have been “paying the price for a war they did not choose”, said UN aid coordination office, OCHA.

Across the vast African nation, 9.3 million people have been uprooted by conflict and more than 4.3 million have fled across borders.

More than 21 million are also believed to be acutely food insecure in Sudan. Here’s OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke:

“Fighting continues across multiple fronts in Kordofan, sieges have cut off the towns of Kadugli and Dilling, restricting food, healthcare and access to farms and markets. In Darfur, fighting on the ground and drone attacks from the sky continue and we have seen long-range strikes on civilian infrastructure far beyond the front lines.”

UN chief insists global body will continue vital work despite U.S. withdrawals

The dramatic announcement by the United States that it intends to withdraw from dozens of UN agencies will not deter the global body’s vital work to protect the world’s most vulnerable people, UN chief António Guterres has insisted.

The U.S. move affects 31 UN entities including UNFPA, which supports family planning along with maternal and child health, and UNFCCC, which oversees global action on climate change.

Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Stephane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, said that the UN chief regretted the U.S. withdrawal, while insisting that the UN “has a responsibility to deliver for those who depend on us”:

“As we have consistently said and underscored, assessed contributions to United Nations regular budget and peacekeeping budget, as approved by the General Assembly, are legal obligations under the United Nations Charter for all Member States, including the United States. All United Nations entities will go on with the implementation of their mandates as given to us by Member States.”

Last July, the U.S. withdrew from the UN educational, scientific and cultural agency, UNESCO, saying its membership was “not in the national interest of the United States”.

Immediately after his re-election, President Trump initiated the withdrawal of the U.S. from the UN World Health Organization, WHO, and the Paris Climate Agreement. He also signed an executive order pulling the U.S. out of the Human Rights Council.

Other UN bodies impacted include those working to protect children in armed conflict and to ending sexual violence as a weapon of war.
