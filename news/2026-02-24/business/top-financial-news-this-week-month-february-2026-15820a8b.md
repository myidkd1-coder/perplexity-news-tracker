Monthly Market Navigator, Jan 31, 2026

Markets rallied to start the year, with international stocks outperforming U.S. companies. Rising long-term interest rates weighed on bond returns; however, investment-grade and high-yield bonds were still able to post modest gains for the month. Looking forward, continued economic growth and market appreciation remain the most likely path in 2026.
