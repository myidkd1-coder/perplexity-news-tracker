Commenting on this trend, Bobby B. Najari, MD, associate professor in the Department of Urology at NYU Langone Health, associate chief, Urology Service, Tisch Hospital, suggested the increased demand is driven by a desire for certain physiques rather than a higher prevalence of testosterone deficiency.
