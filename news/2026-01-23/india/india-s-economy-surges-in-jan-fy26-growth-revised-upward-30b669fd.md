ECONOMY

India's economic pulse quickened in January, with the HSBC Composite Flash PMI jumping to 59.5, signaling renewed momentum. This surge reinforces an upgraded outlook for the current fiscal year (FY2025-26), with institutions like the IMF now forecasting 7.3% growth. However, projections for the next fiscal year (FY2026-27) indicate a moderation to around 6.4% to 6.6%, attributed to waning cyclical factors and global economic headwinds.

1. THE SEAMLESS LINK

The robust expansion in India's business activity, highlighted by January's PMI data, provides an encouraging backdrop to an economic outlook that has seen significant upward revisions for the current fiscal year. This January uptick follows strong performance in the latter half of the previous fiscal year, leading major international agencies to revise their growth projections for FY2025-26 higher. While this resilience is notable, the focus is shifting to the anticipated moderation in growth for the upcoming fiscal year.

January's Economic Pulse

India's business activity demonstrated a notable acceleration in January, with the HSBC Composite Flash PMI climbing to 59.5 from 57.8 in December 2025. This marks the first time in five months that the pace of overall economic expansion has quickened, indicating a resurgence in momentum across both manufacturing and services sectors. The current reading comfortably surpasses the long-run average composite PMI of around 53.75-54.9, signaling an economy operating in an expansionary phase. This January strength contrasts with a more subdued December performance, where the manufacturing PMI registered its weakest improvement in two years at 55.0, and the services PMI eased to an 11-month low of 58.0.

FY2025-26 Growth Surge

Contrary to earlier projections of a slowdown, India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year (FY2025-26) has been substantially revised upward by numerous institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now estimates India's GDP to grow by 7.3% for FY2025-26, a significant upgrade from its earlier 6.6% projection, citing stronger-than-expected outturns in the second and third quarters of 2025 and robust momentum. This aligns with other optimistic assessments, including the National Statistical Office's projection of 7.4% and Fitch Ratings' upward revision to 7.4%. The Reserve Bank of India also anticipates 7.3% growth for the fiscal year. This resilience is attributed to strong domestic demand, particularly private consumption, robust public investment, the impact of tax reforms like GST rationalisation, and favourable agricultural performance.

The 2026 Outlook - Moderation Ahead

Looking towards the next fiscal year (FY2026-27), forecasts suggest a moderation in India's growth trajectory. The IMF projects growth to ease to 6.4% in 2026 and 2027, as cyclical and temporary factors wane and global economic conditions evolve. Similarly, the United Nations forecasts a growth rate of 6.6% for 2026, moderating from an estimated 7.4% in 2025. This anticipated deceleration is linked to evolving global trade conditions, a more challenging external environment due to tariffs and geopolitical realignments, and slowing global demand. Despite this projected slowdown, India is expected to remain one of the fastest-growing major economies globally.

Inflationary Undercurrents

While economic growth remains robust, inflation figures show a slight uptick. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose to 1.33% in December 2025 from 0.71% in November, still well within the Reserve Bank of India's comfort zone. However, core inflation, excluding food and fuel, hardened to a 28-month high of 4.8% in December. Analysts anticipate headline CPI to move above 2.0% in January 2026, reflecting broader price pressures.

Global Economic Crosscurrents

India's economic performance stands out against a backdrop of a projected subdued global economy for 2026, expected to grow by 2.7%. Elevated uncertainty, persistent trade tensions, and tightening fiscal conditions globally pose headwinds. While the world economy showed resilience in 2025, a prolonged period of slower growth is a risk due to weak investment and limited fiscal space. India's domestic demand resilience and strategic investments are positioning it as a bright spot amidst these global challenges.
