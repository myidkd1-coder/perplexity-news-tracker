Could India face 75% US tariffs? Day after US ambassador to India Sergio Gor claimed no partner is more essential to the United States than India, Donald Trump announced a new 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran. India is among Iran's top five trading partners. It’s already the most tariffed country in the world with Trump slapping a whopping 50% tariff on New Delhi last year, with 25% being punishment for buying Russian oil. Now, the latest 25% Iran linked tariff could mean that Indian exports to the US may well face a 75% tariff.
