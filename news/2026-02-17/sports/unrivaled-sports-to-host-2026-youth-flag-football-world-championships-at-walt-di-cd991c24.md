World's largest youth flag football tournament returns to ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, featuring nearly 1,000 teams and 10,000 athletes

KISSIMMEE, Fla., Feb. 17, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Unrivaled Sports, the nation's leader in youth sports experiences, today announced the 2026 Youth Flag Football World Championships, presented by Under Armour, will take place February 19-22, 2026 at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida.

Recognized as the world's largest youth flag football tournament, the event will welcome nearly 1,000 teams and 10,000 athletes for four days of elite competition and celebration of one of the fastest-growing sports in the world. In total, seven countries will be represented by the teams playing in the tournament, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, China, England and the Bahamas.

The Youth Flag Football World Championships serve as the marquee event within Unrivaled Flag's growing national ecosystem, connecting teams from local and regional play to the premier championship stage and reinforcing Unrivaled Flag's commitment to delivering best-in-class youth sports experiences.

"Flag football has unprecedented momentum and the Youth Flag Football World Championships are a powerful example of how quickly the sport is growing at the youth level," said Jim Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer, Field Sports, Unrivaled Sports. "Bringing 10,000 athletes to the historic ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex reflects the scale of this movement and our commitment to its growth, delivering unforgettable experiences for athletes and families."

All Division 1 Championship games on Saturday, February 21 and Sunday, February 22 will also stream live on ESPN+.

In addition to its role as presenting sponsor, Under Armour will outfit all teams at the Youth Flag Football World Championships with on-field performance gear.

"Under Armour is excited to be the presenting sponsor of the 2026 Youth Flag Football World Championships and provide every athlete competing in Florida with our on-field performance gear," said Craig Cummings, Under Armour Vice President of Team Division. "We share Unrivaled Sports' commitment to growing the game of flag football, and we're energized to invest in an athlete-first experience that gives thousands of young players the opportunity to compete at their best."

The event will also feature special onsite appearances from legendary quarterback Drew Brees, and U.S. Women's Flag National Team player and Unrivaled Flag athlete Ashlea Klam, who will be at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex to support the teams, engage with athletes and celebrate the continued growth of the game. Last year, Unrivaled Sports entered into an official partnership with Brees by welcoming Football 'N' America (FNA) — the premier youth flag football league co-founded by Brees — into its growing family of leading youth sports brands. The company also recently partnered with Klam to expand the reach of flag football and create more pathways for girls flag athletes, including new showcase events for college recruiting and skill clinics.

"Flag football is growing in an incredible way, and so are we here at ESPN Wide World of Sports," said ESPN Wide World of Sports Vice President Adam Ball. "Our cast members can't wait to welcome young athletes and families alongside our friends at Unrivaled Flag to create an experience where everyone can come together to compete and celebrate the game with some Disney magic."
