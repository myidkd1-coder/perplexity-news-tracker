It establishes a sound and complete equational theory, enabling analysis and verification of diagram equivalence. The calculus relies on a diagrammatic foundation rooted in category theory, with diagrams represented as matrices and connected via a reducing normal form. By proving equivalences through a functor and ensuring soundness, the approach provides a versatile framework for diagrammatic computation across quantum, classical, and stochastic domains, advancing formal reasoning in computational diagrams.
