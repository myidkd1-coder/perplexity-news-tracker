Software companies decline on AI disruption concerns

US equity markets delivered divergent performance as technology sector sell-offs attracted dip-buying interest. The Dow Jones advanced 2.5%, breaching 50,000 for the first time, whilst the S&P 500 closed marginally lower at -0.1% and the Nasdaq 100 declined 1.9%.

The S&P 500 Software & Services Index experienced significant repricing, declining 7.5% over the week and extending year-to-date losses to 18.6%. The selloff accelerated following Anthropic's release of enhanced plugins for its Claude Cowork artificial intelligence (AI) platform, which automate functions across legal, finance, sales, marketing and data analysis workflows. Market participants intensified concerns that AI agents may fundamentally displace traditional enterprise software solutions.

The decline affected companies throughout the software value chain, from financial data providers such as FactSet Research (-18.5%) to private equity firms with substantial software portfolios including KKR (-9.7%). Whilst AI-related disruption risks have circulated for some time, last week's sharp market reaction indicates heightened investor sensitivity to negative developments, particularly among positions established at elevated valuations during the latter stages of the rally.

Separately, concerns regarding AI monetisation have intensified following aggressive capital expenditure guidance from major technology platforms. The leading hyperscalers (Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta) collectively project approximately $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending for 2026 based on latest official guidance, representing roughly 75-80% growth from 2025 levels and placing considerable pressure on free cash flow generation.

From a technical perspective, the US Tech 100 exhibits a double-top formation following rejection at 26,218. The relative strength index (RSI) continues displaying bearish divergence, whilst the recent breach below the 50-day moving average (MA) adds another negative signal, potentially targeting support near 23,800. Until the index reclaims the 25,850 pivot on a closing basis, establishing new historical highs appears unlikely in the near term.
