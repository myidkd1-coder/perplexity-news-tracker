British and French Jets Bomb ISIS Weapons Facility North of Palmyra in Joint Air Strike In Syria

British and French fighter jets launched a precision airstrike on a suspected Islamic State arms facility north of Palmyra, Syria, Saturday evening. The underground cache, believed to store weapons and explosives used by the extremist group, was targeted using Paveway IV guided bombs dropped from Typhoon FGR4 jets. Officials confirmed the area was free of civilians and all aircraft returned safely.
