FDA panel recommends testosterone therapy be more accessible to men, knocks ‘outdated’ restrictions

New York Post

An FDA panel has recommended loosening restrictions on testosterone replacement therapy by declassifying it as a controlled substance and updating labels to expand access. Bobby B. Najari, MD, associate professor in the Department of Urology at NYU Langone Health, associate chief, Urology Service, Tisch Hospital, commented on the current challenges. He noted that the narrow FDA labeling means only a minority of men who could benefit are considered for on-label treatment. Dr. Najari also explained that because TRT is a controlled substance, administrative burdens like state website lookups and no refill prescriptions limit the number of prescribers who can care for these patients.
