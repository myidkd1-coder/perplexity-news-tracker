What it's about: "The Immortal Man" picks up in 1940, years after the events of "Peaky Blinders." Cillian Murphy returns to Birmingham as iconic gangster Tommy Shelby, and this time, more than just his fate is at stake in this feature-length film.

Why you should watch it: If you loved the original "Peaky Blinders" series, then adding this movie to your watchlist is a no-brainer.
