India and Israel will pursue joint development, production and transfer of technology in defence, as well as work on a free trade agreement, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.

Here are some details on what the two countries agreed upon during Modi’s two-day visit to Israel.

The two countries will cooperate in the field of “horizon scanning”, which would enhance India’s strategic capabilities, an Indian foreign ministry statement said.

This would help strengthen strategic foresight, risk assessment, and technology planning through joint research, capacity building and AI-driven tools, it said.

Israel would allow 50,000 additional Indian workers into the country over the next five years, especially in manufacturing sectors, the statement said.

Modi said India would continue to consult, and cooperate with all partners on establishing peace in West Asia.

“The Gaza peace plan has opened a pathway to peace, and India has extended its full support to these efforts,” he said during a joint press briefing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Modi is visiting as the United States deploys a vast naval force near Iran’s coast ahead of possible strikes on the Islamic Republic, with the two countries at an impasse in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
