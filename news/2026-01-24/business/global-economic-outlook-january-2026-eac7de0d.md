## Summary
S&P Global forecasts similar global economic conditions in 2026 with near-potential real GDP growth, expecting slowdowns in China, India, Canada, Brazil, eurozone, and UK due to trade factors and tariff effects. US growth sees a slight upward revision for 2025-2026 based on recent data, with PMIs indicating stable but weakening momentum.

## Full Article
Arguably the key macroeconomic theme of 2025 was the remarkable resilience of economic activity — and ﬁnancial markets, April excepted — during a period of high uncertainty related to seismic shifts in US policy across a range of issues. Our current forecasts imply similar global economic conditions during 2026, in other words, a continuation of near-potential real GDP growth.

Continued resilience of growth to geopolitical developments is not guaranteed. One escalating concern is that developments that we would have previously considered to be “tail” risks — for example, US-EU tensions over Greenland — have become more probable. Another is the US administration introducing another layer of tariffs to those “doing business” with Iran. At the same time, the AI spending-related boost to growth could be giving a misleading impression of how resilient economic conditions would be to additional adverse shocks.
