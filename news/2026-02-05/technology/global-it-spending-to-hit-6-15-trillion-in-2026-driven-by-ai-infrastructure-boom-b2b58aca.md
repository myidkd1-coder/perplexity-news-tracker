## Full Article
Global IT spending will grow 10.8% to reach $6.15 trillion in 2026, Gartner said in its latest forecast, with AI infrastructure accounting for the lion’s share of that growth.

The forecast shows a spending spree that shows no signs of slowing down, despite growing chatter about an AI bubble. Enterprises and cloud providers alike are opening their wallets for AI-related hardware and software, with data center systems leading the charge, according to the research firm.

“AI infrastructure growth remains rapid despite concerns about an AI bubble, with spending rising across AI‑related hardware and software,” John-David Lovelock, distinguished VP analyst at Gartner said in the report. “Demand from hyperscale cloud providers continues to drive investment in servers optimized for AI workloads.”
