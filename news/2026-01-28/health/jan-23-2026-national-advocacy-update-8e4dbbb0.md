Those considering participating in the model must apply by April 1 to be considered for a Jan. 1, 2027, start date. The ACCESS model Request for Applications (PDF) was released last month and provides detailed information about the four tracks of the model and what will be expected of participants. ACCESS is a voluntary model that will test use of new technologies in supporting patients managing certain chronic conditions. Model participants will receive “outcome aligned payments” tied to the level of improvement their patients achieve in their health outcomes for the chronic diseases included in the model relative to each patient’s starting point. More information is available in a podcast interview that AMA CEO John Whyte, MD, MPH, conducted with the director of the CMS Innovation Center, Abe Sutton.

CMS has also announced that there will be a webinar on Jan. 29 to learn more about the Long-Term Enhanced Accountable Care Organization Design model, or LEAD ACO, which was also the topic of a podcast interview conducted by Dr. Whyte. The CMS webinar will discuss the LEAD model goals, participation options, eligibility and payment methodology. Register to attend.
