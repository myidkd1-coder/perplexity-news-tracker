## Summary
Key trends include expansion of AI in healthcare research and cancer treatment, insurance coverage shifts like Medi-Cal enrollment freezes, and exponential advancements in life sciences such as gene editing, CRISPR, mRNA vaccines for cancer, and robotic surgery.

Over the last few years, I have written for the Rockefeller Institute about trends in healthcare. In 2023, I chose ten trends, including staffing challenges, the increasing role of non-traditional players in health, such as Walmart and CVS, as well as the increasing role of private equity in healthcare, the movement toward value-based care, and the growing use of digital health—all trends that I expect to continue. In 2024, I highlighted a mega trend specific to the provider community, in which a number of factors had combined to lead to the segmentation of the industry into three different categories of entities. Those included what I categorized broadly as “today” entities (i.e., those that we know as traditional providers, many of whom are fighting for their sustainability), “tomorrow” entities (i.e., non-traditional entities that are not necessarily healthcare entities but are in the healthcare space and are typically part of a larger conglomerate or backed with private equity), and “striving survivors” (i.e., today entities that are adapting radically or partnering with tomorrow entities to exist in the future).

The following January, I picked five issues to watch in healthcare in 2025. They were (1) the continued expansion of computational data technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI); (2) insurance coverage shifts; (3) consolidation in the overall industry; (4) payment, costs, and coverage for pharmaceuticals; and (5) exponential advancements in life sciences.

This blog reviews the status of those 2025 trends and suggests one additional issue that may garner more attention in 2026: the overall cost, pricing, and affordability of healthcare. I discuss the factors pushing this issue into the spotlight and potential options for policymakers to counteract this trend.

A Status Review of the Five 2025 Trends

Before delving into the newly highlighted trend of the cost, price, and affordability of healthcare, it is worth briefly reviewing the status of the five trends that were identified in 2025, since all of them will continue to be important in 2026.

Insurance coverage shifts Issue Updates. In January 2025, I noted the possibility that insurance coverage was likely to shift, in part, because of the possible expiration of the Enhanced Premium Tax Credits (EPTCs) at the end of 2025. The EPTCs were enhanced in 2021 under the American Rescue Plan Act and are sometimes referred to as the “Obamacare subsidies.” They were intended to reduce the cost that people pay when they obtain coverage from qualified health plans on the health exchanges. Although some proposals were made by both Democrats and Republicans at the end of 2025 to help mitigate the impact of the loss of the EPTCs, none of the proposals were able to gain enough bipartisan support to be signed into legislation in 2025, resulting in a spike in costs for premiums starting January 1, 2026. As this blog was being written, Congress was debating the possible partial extension of these credits in some form, although passage was not certain. Either way, it is likely that healthcare coverage will continue to be a topic of much debate in Congress in 2026. In addition, in 2025, changes made to Medicaid coverage in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (otherwise known as HR1) are also likely to impact insurance costs and coverage in 2026. The changes to health insurance coverage in HR1 were outlined in a paper by the Institute in mid-2025 and will have varying impacts on both funding and coverage over the coming months and years. As I later wrote about with colleagues, additional federal rule changes in 2025 will also impact public insurance coverage in the future. The Urban Institute estimates that close to five million people may lose coverage in 2026, although the exact number who lose coverage versus those who choose cheaper and less expansive coverage options with fewer benefits has yet to be fully analyzed. Policy Responses and Options. With the expiration of the EPTCs and changes in federal reimbursement for coverage of immigrant populations, state policymakers will need to make decisions in 2026 about who and what may be covered with state-only dollars. States appear to be taking different approaches. By mid-2025, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that of the 14 states that offer health coverage to at least some immigrants, at least three had proposed limits on coverage (some ending it altogether and others restricting it). For example, on January 1, 2026, Medi-Cal, which is California’s Medicaid program, will freeze any new enrollments for certain undocumented adults who receive state-funded full-scope services. In June 2025, the Minnesota legislature voted to limit eligibility for persons over age 18 who are undocumented. New York has applied to federal regulators seeking to change the authorization for its successful Essential Plan—that provides coverage to some 1.7 million New Yorkers, including certain legally present immigrants—from a revocable federal waiver to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) specified Basic Health Program. Expect to see many other states taking actions to either drop or preserve health insurance coverage in 2026. What impact these changes have on the extent of coverage and the number of newly uninsured people this year remains to be seen.
