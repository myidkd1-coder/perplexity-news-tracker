## Full Article
Minister of State with responsibility for Migration, Colm Brophy, travelled to India from 7 to 12 January, followed by a visit to Abu Dhabi from 12 to 13 January. During his time to India, Minister Brophy visited the Irish Embassy and Visa Office and held meetings with senior colleagues in the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs. These engagements focused on progressing trade and investment, legal migration pathways, education links, and co-operation on shared priorities at EU level.

There is a strong and growing economic relationship between Ireland and India. Two-way trade has expanded significantly over the past decade, with combined trade now standing at just over €16 billion, an increase of approximately €12.5 billion. While services account for the majority of bilateral trade, this growth highlights the importance of continued engagement to unlock further opportunities.

At EU level, Ireland has welcomed renewed engagement with India, including the development of a new EU-India Strategic Agenda and the planned EU-India Summit scheduled for the end of January 2026. Ireland also supports EU initiatives that promote safe, orderly and legal mobility, including the EU Talent Pool, which complements national migration systems and is relevant to a range of partner countries.
