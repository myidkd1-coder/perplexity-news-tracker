“IDC forecasts that from 2026 onward, the acceleration of AI/agent-based business utilization and the modernization of existing systems will be key drivers of transformation in the Japanese IT market. Fujitsu’s announcement aims to redefine complex legacy system assets into a state where AI can accurately understand and process them, and to automate the entire waterfall development process. This initiative is expected to provide a practical pathway for many domestic enterprises facing the ongoing challenge of maintaining and operating legacy assets, while also promoting a shift in software engineering away from a labor-intensive model.”



Shinji Kajitani, Director and President Executive Officer, Optima Corporation

“I am deeply impressed by the concept of automating the entire software development process from upstream to downstream using AI, and even entrusting the verification process to AI. This overturns the traditional assumption that human checks are ultimately indispensable, and I see great potential, especially in targeting business packages that undergo complex system changes every year. Our company has also been involved in business package modifications for many years, and how to complete system revisions with high quality in a short period has always been a major challenge. We believe that the knowledge and expertise accumulated during that process can significantly contribute to the realization and advancement of this concept. Our company will continue to contribute to the business expansion of Fujitsu and Fujitsu Japan through ongoing cooperation, not limited to this project.”



Hiroshi Nakatani, Representative Director, Executive Vice President, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.

"This AI automation initiative promoted by Fujitsu is not merely about improving development efficiency; we recognize it as a significant challenge to pass on and evolve the extensive business knowledge and design philosophies cultivated by companies over many years to the next generation. In particular, the concept of providing end-to-end support, from requirements definition to design, implementation, and quality assurance, triggered by changes in laws and rules, opens up new possibilities in areas that have traditionally relied on human experience and tacit knowledge. We see great significance in AI functioning as a foundation that supports human judgment and creativity, rather than replacing it.

In the manufacturing industry, challenges such as design changes, regulatory compliance, and understanding the scope of impact are becoming increasingly complex year by year. Fujitsu's approach of advancing both knowledge standardization and AI utilization in these areas offers valuable insights for enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of the entire industry.

Kawasaki Heavy Industries sincerely hopes that this initiative will be a crucial step in driving the transformation of Japanese manufacturing and a wide range of other industries, and we wholeheartedly support its further development."



Yasushi Matsuda, President and CEO, Kewpie Digital Innovation Co., Ltd.

“Systems have become increasingly complex through years of operation and often now require significant maintenance effort. While the introduction of generative AI has improved auditing efficiency, its accuracy remains insufficient for reliable practical application. Amidst this situation, we place great expectations on “Multi-layer Quality Control,” which automatically corrects ambiguities and omissions. We are confident that this mechanism, where AI itself audits quality and autonomously repeats processes, will dramatically enhance the reliability of system development. We eagerly await its future development.”



Junichi Aruji, Managing Director, Kintetsu Information System Co., Ltd.

“The challenge of revamping existing systems has long been a significant one for engineers. Fujitsu’s AI-Driven Software Development Platform has the potential to dramatically transform the labor previously involved in understanding complex laws and regulations, analyzing vast historical assets, and grasping the tacit knowledge of the field.

What is particularly noteworthy is the AI's ability to autonomously learn "human intelligence," thereby dramatically enhancing the accuracy of requirements definition. Furthermore, it can complete everything from program structure analysis and standardization to the extensive testing phase with incredible speed and comprehensiveness. This makes it possible to deliver high-quality products in a short period.

As the role of AI expands and frees people from routine tasks, engineers can focus on more creative activities. I have high expectations for the paradigm shift in system renovation that this solution will bring.”



Yumi Ueno, Managing Director, Partner Ecosystem & Corporate Business, Google Cloud Japan G.K.

“This initiative to achieve comprehensive, one-stop automation spanning from requirements definition to system validation is a groundbreaking innovation for the industry. The technology enables AI to accurately understand vast assets, including long-established programs and design documentation, and we are delighted at the potential for both production-grade quality and exceptional productivity gains. We are confident that this platform will become the new standard for development and accelerate our customers' digital transformation. We remain committed to working with Fujitsu to address social challenges through AI.”



Masahiro Niimi, Managing Executive Officer, Head of Information Systems Management Division, CISO, Sakura KCS Corporation

“I believe Fujitsu Limited's AI-driven development framework has the potential to become the ‘new paradigm of system development.’ It cannot be achieved simply by feeding existing code or design information into AI, and while there are various hurdles, such as converting documentation to Markdown and establishing test environments, overcoming these hurdles can lead to solving traditional system development challenges (like QCD).

What particularly caught my attention is not just improvements in the development process, but what comes after generative AI, i.e., the incorporation of detailed specifications and code (logic). I see tremendous potential here as a solution to the greatest challenge: visualizing and transferring the tacit knowledge of veteran software engineers’ that is traditionally missing from documentation. We expect generative AI to act as an advisor for less experienced software engineers, readily answering questions anytime, thereby dramatically advancing know-how transfer to the next generation. On the other hand, this mechanism also has the potential to dramatically change the traditional SI business model, and we are watching future developments closely.”



Takao Kazama, Executive Officer, Group Companies and Accounting & Finance, The Shizuoka Shimbun and Shizuoka Broadcasting Co., Ltd.

"This initiative for complete automation of application development and maintenance represents a highly valuable transformation for our company. It formalizes and establishes a reproducible process for tasks that have long relied on the implicit knowledge and experience of individual staff members, and we have great expectations for it. In particular, it has the potential to significantly improve quality variations in legacy system maintenance and lost opportunities due to delayed change responses. Furthermore, the evolving ability of AI to perform root cause analysis and identify necessary additional information is a major step towards advanced and efficient system operations, with the potential to change the very nature of system development. We share Fujitsu's commitment to improving productivity across the entire industry and establishing new development standards. We look forward to its continued strong promotion as an initiative that will advance the entire industry."

"The AI-Driven Software Development Platform presented by Fujitsu offers a practical and robust approach to the long-standing challenges faced by medical institutions: the increasing complexity of medical fee calculations and the growing workload of claims processing. The mechanism where AI analyzes legal documents and extracts the relevant areas, while explicitly highlighting points open to interpretation to supplement human judgment, is particularly impressive. This design demonstrates a deep understanding of on-site operations and is highly commendable. Furthermore, the Japanese-specific LLM and the consideration for safety are indispensable elements for AI utilization in the medical field. Beyond medical fee claims, this technology has potential for integration with related areas such as bed management and understanding performance requirements, making a strong contribution to overall hospital operational efficiency in the future. This is a promising initiative that warrants positive consideration for adoption to alleviate the burden on medical professionals."
