And in West Darfur state on Saturday, one civilian was reported killed following two drone attacks in the vicinity of Kulbus. More than 600 people have been displaced by the strikes there, according to UN humanitarian partners.

Deaths and injuries

In South Kordofan state, multiple drone attacks between 1 and 3 January in Dilling reportedly resulted in civilian deaths and injuries.

The situation remains dire in Dilling, with civilians trapped under siege as humanitarian conditions continuing to deteriorate, while access to essential supplies is increasingly restricted.

“We reiterate our call for the protection of civilians and for the unhindered humanitarian access to all affected areas,” Mr. Dujarric underscored.

“Continued and predictable humanitarian access to deliver life-saving assistance and to prevent further deterioration of the humanitarian situation is essential.”

Last Friday, a strike on a high-rise block in the eastern city killed six residents including a mother and child, according to reports.

In addition, dozens more were hurt in the attack, and many were left homeless, amid freezing conditions and snow, according to the UN aid coordination office, OCHA.

In addition, parts of the city near the Russian frontier were left without electricity, water and gas.

Civilians face growing danger

“Further attacks are being reported in the city, risking additional harm to civilians and further destruction of homes as temperatures remain well below zero,” said Maka Khazalia, OCHA Head of Office in Kharkiv.

“Humanitarian teams continue to support those affected by the attack and will continue to provide assistance to those affected in future.”

UN humanitarians work alongside partners and city staff, providing essential services to those in need.

This includes delivering hot meals, non-food items and mental health support.

There were also reported attacks in Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions which caused civilian casualties and damage to critical infrastructure, resulting in power outages.

Humanitarian colleagues also note that on 2 January, authorities announced mandatory evacuations of more than 3,000 children and their families from frontline areas in Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia Regions.

Refugee response now at breaking point in Ethiopia, warns WFP

In Ethiopia, the global crisis in funding for humanitarian work is taking a major toll, with aid teams warning that the refugee response there is at breaking point.

The UN World Food Programme (WFP) alerted that more than 1.1 million people risk losing “food, water and healthcare within weeks”, due to lack of funding.

Ethiopia is the second-largest refugee-hosting country in Africa and has seen a surge in arrivals amid ongoing conflicts in Sudan and South Sudan, as well as drought in Somalia.

More than a million refugees have already endured prolonged ration cuts since May 2023 and WFP has now had to cut food assistance again, from 60 per cent to 40 per cent.

WFP calls for urgent funding

“Beyond humanitarian assistance, sustained funding is urgently needed to support solutions that help refugees rebuild their lives,” said Claire Nevill, WFP Head of Communications in Ethiopia.

“Without immediate support, more services will be cut, and more lives will be at risk.”

She insisted that the Government of Ethiopia, WFP and the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) were aiming to provide vulnerable people fleeing conflict and hunger with long-term livelihood opportunities, including jobs.

But additional support will be needed to support sustainable projects so that refugees can rebuild their lives, she said.
