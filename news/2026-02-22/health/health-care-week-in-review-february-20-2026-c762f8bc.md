Reports, Studies & Analyses

On February 19, 2026, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report entitled, High Risk Research: HHS Should Publicly Share More Information on How Risk Is Assessed and Mitigated. The report examined the outcomes of gain-of-function research of concern and related risk mitigation strategies, as recently introduced legislation and executive actions have aimed to restrict or ban federal departments and agencies from conducting or funding such research. GAO reviewed literature and other sources published between 2019 and 2024; assessed HHS procedures for reviewing risks and risk mitigation strategies; examined federal policies and guidance for the oversight of higher-risk pathogen research; interviewed HHS officials; and interviewed biosafety and biosecurity experts who authored relevant articles and have experience with gain-of-function research of concern.



The report found that gain-of-function research of concern has advanced scientific knowledge of how pathogens infect humans and transmit and cause disease. However, GAO noted that there is no broad consensus on the extent to which this research has led to the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Notably, there was broad consensus that this research can pose biosafety and biosecurity risks, as it can involve enhancing the transmissibility or virulence of pathogens that have the potential to cause widespread and uncontrollable disease, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality if they were to be accidentally or deliberately released. GAO recommended that HHS ensure that key information on its risk reviews of research involving pathogens is publicly shared, including steps taken to mitigate risk. HHS neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but noted it will work in the future to ensure public transparency about the scope of research involving higher-risk pathogens and actions taken to mitigate risks.

On February 19, 2026, GAO released a report entitled, Private Health Insurance: Provider Participation and Payments for Selected Services Before and After the No Surprises Act. The report analyzed health insurance claims, focusing on four specialties most likely to be affected by the prohibition on balance billing enacted in the No Surprises Act . GAO examined trends in in-network claims and payments between 2019 and 2023 and interviewed representatives from 20 stakeholder groups, including specialty provider associations, issuers, and state insurance departments. Among specialties likely to be affected by the No Suprises Act, including emergency medicine, radiology, anesthesiology, and air ambulance, the percentage of in-network claims increased for three of the four specialties after the law took effect. Changes in payment rates for the selected services largely continued trends that existed prior to implementation of the law. For example, inflation-adjusted payments for in-network emergency medicine services billed by facilities increased in 2022 and 2023, consistent with trends since 2019. Moreover, inflation-adjusted payments for in-network emergency services billed by physicians or their practices decreased in 2022 and 2023, continuing previous trends.

Other Health Policy News

Federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expired on February 13, 2026, triggering a shutdown isolated solely to DHS activities. Most notably, this affects the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Coast Guard, all of which will continue operating essential functions without pay. The shutdown occurs as Democrats are engaged with ongoing negotiations with the White House and Republicans over reforms to the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement practices. Democrats have asked for a prohibition on immigration raids at sensitive areas, including hospitals, as well as judicial warrants for all other raids. DHS operations will continue to operate under a shutdown until an agreement between the two parties is reached.

On February 17, 2026, Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) released a report entitled, Patients and Families First: Building the FDA of the Future. The report argues that FDA’s current regulatory framework is unpredictable, fragmented, and poorly aligned with the pace of biomedical digital innovation. A central theme of the report is the need for more modern and flexible clinical evidence models. While FDA has recognized innovative trial designs, the report notes that the traditional clinical trial is evolving and that FDA “could do more to expand the use of novel trail designs and technologies to garner better data…and reduce costs.” This includes expanding digital health technologies and ensuring validation requirements are tailored to their actual risk.



The report also highlights growing concerns around FDA’s approach to artificial intelligence (AI). It calls for a clear, risk-based framework, emphasizing that the agency should take a risk-based approach to regulating AI and provide broadly applicable guidance on AI use to avoid delays and provide FDA reviewers with the tools and expertise needed to oversee the deployment of AI-enabled technologies. Moreover, the report argues that outdated pathways for biologics and biosimilars hinder competition, noting the need for a new middle regulatory option. Additionally, the report calls for clearer premarket guidance and greater adoption of tools for medical device oversight. It cites that manufacturers report “delays, inconsistent review practices, and limited opportunities for real-time engagement with FDA reviewers,” which contributes to the “Valley of Death,” in which fewer than 10 percent of breakthrough-designated products reach market. The report calls for clearer premarket guidance and greater adoption of tools such as predetermined change control plans to keep pace with technologies that evolve rapidly.

On February 18, 2026, Democratic leaders of the House Energy & Commerce Committee sent a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. regarding the cancelation of millions of dollars in health care funding in four Democratic-led states. The four affected states, including California, Colorado, Illinois, and Minnesota, sued HHS last week over the terminated grants. In the letter, Members stated that the decision to terminate the funding “threatens each of these states’ ability to respond to and prepare for public health emergencies.” When notifying Congress of the termination, HHS stated that the grants were inconsistent with agency priorities.

On February 18, 2026, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) entitled, Promoting the National Defense by Ensuring an Adequate Supply of Elemental Phosphorus and Glyphosate-Based Herbicides. The EO promotes the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides, citing that the materials are essential to military readiness and agricultural strength, respectively. The EO authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of War, to require the “performance of contracts or orders related to these materials to promote the national defense,” and to determine the “proper allocation of materials, services, and facilities to ensure adequate supply.” Supporters of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda have criticized the EO, emphasizing that it promotes the production of harmful pesticides.

On February 18, 2026, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya was appointed as Acting CDC Director, while maintaining his current role. The announcement follows the departure of HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill, who was also serving as Acting CDC Director. Additionally, Secretary Kennedy announced that he was elevating the CMS Director for Medicare Chris Klomp to Chief Counselor for HHS, and CMS Chief Policy and Regulatory Officer John Brooks to Senior Counselor for CMS. Secretary Kennedy is also elevating Kyle Diamantas, Deputy Commissioner for Human Foods at FDA, and Grace Graham, Deputy Commissioner for Policy at FDA, to Senior FDA Counselor positions in his staff. Each of these individuals will also retain their current roles within CMS and FDA.





In February 2026, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued new Medicare Advantage Industry Segment-Specific Compliance Program Guidance (MA ICPG). The MA ICPG is OIG’s first update in 27 years to its 1999 Medicare+ Choice Compliance Program (1999 CPG). The new MA ICPG outlines seven compliance risk areas and provides corresponding recommendations for mitigation. While the MA ICPG carries forward many of the risk areas identified in the 1999 CPG, the updated guidance focuses even more on practices that support data accuracy. Medicare Advantage Organization (MAOs)—and what OIG more broadly defines as the “MA Parties,” meaning “the wide range of entities and individuals participating in or engaged with the [Medicare Advantage (MA)] program”—should use OIG’s roadmap to evaluate and update their compliance infrastructure to mitigate these risk areas. Companies may find that enforcement agencies are less forgiving about issues OIG explicitly highlights in the updated guidance.

On February 20, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The ruling effectively invalidates current tariff rates on countries like China, Canada, and Mexico, while also endangering the stability of trade deals that the Trump Administration negotiated with others, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, South Korea, and Japan. The Supreme Court did not address refunds of tariffs that have already been collected, which total approximately $170 billion, leaving that decision to be further deliberated by the lower court. When asked, President Trump expressed frustration that the Supreme Court did not address the refund issue, stating, “We’ll end up being in court for the next five years”.



The Supreme Court’s decision only affects global tariffs established under IEEPA and does not address tariffs established on specific products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which includes steel, aluminum, and automobiles. Pharmaceuticals, copper, semiconductors, critical minerals, and polysilicon are also being investigated by the Administration for a potential Section 232 tariff. President Trump has stated that he intends to pursue other authorities that permit him to establish tariffs on trading partners who threaten domestic industry, discriminate against U.S. businesses or commerce, or violate U.S. rights under a trade agreement. Using the authority granted to the President under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for example, he has stated he will impose a 10 percent global tariff rate, although this can only last for 150 days without Congressional approval. The President said the Section 122 tariffs would be effective starting Monday.
